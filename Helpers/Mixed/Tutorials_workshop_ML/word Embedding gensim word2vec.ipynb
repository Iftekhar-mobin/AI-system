       "[' in computer science artificial intelligence ai sometimes called machine intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals leading ai textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals colloquially the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines or computers that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind such as learning and problem solving as machines become increasingly capable tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of ai a phenomenon known as the ai effect a quip in tesler s theorem says ai is whatever hasn t been done yet for instance optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be ai having become a routine technology modern machine capabilities generally classified as ai include successfully understanding human speech competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and go autonomously operating cars intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism followed by disappointment and the loss of funding known as an ai winter followed by new approaches success and renewed funding for most of its history ai research has been divided into sub fields that often fail to communicate with each other these sub fields are based on technical considerations such as particular goals e g robotics or machine learning the use of particular tools logic or artificial neural networks or deep philosophical differences sub fields have also been based on social factors particular institutions or the work of particular researchers the traditional problems or goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects general intelligence is among the field s long term goals approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic ai many tools are used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics probability and economics the ai field draws upon computer science information engineering mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy and many other fields the field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it this raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human like intelligence these issues have been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity some people also consider ai to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated others believe that ai unlike previous technological revolutions will create a risk of mass unemployment in the twenty first century ai techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power large amounts of data and theoretical understanding and ai techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science software engineering and operations research thought capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity and have been common in fiction as in mary shelley s frankenstein or karel apek s r u r rossum s universal robots these characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of mathematical logic led directly to alan turing s theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction this insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the church turing thesis along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology information theory and cybernetics this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour the first work that is now generally recognized as ai was mccullouch and pitts formal design for turing complete artificial neurons the field of ai research was born at a workshop at dartmouth college in where the term artificial intelligence was coined by john mccarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist norbert wiener attendees allen newell cmu herbert simon cmu john mccarthy mit marvin minsky mit and arthur samuel ibm became the founders and leaders of ai research they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing computers were learning checkers strategies c and by were reportedly playing better than the average human solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems logic theorist first run c and speaking english by the middle of the s research in the u s was heavily funded by the department of defense and laboratories had been established around the world ai s founders were optimistic about the future herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do marvin minsky agreed writing within a generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved they failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks progress slowed and in in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the u s and british governments cut off exploratory research in ai the next few years would later be called an ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japan s fifth generation computer project inspired the u s and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longer lasting hiatus began the development of metal oxide semiconductor mos very large scale integration vlsi in the form of complementary mos cmos transistor technology enabled the development of practical artificial neural network ann technology in the s a landmark publication in the field was the book analog vlsi implementation of neural systems by carver a mead and mohammed ismail in the late s and early st century ai began to be used for logistics data mining medical diagnosis and other areas the success was due to increasing computational power see moore s law and transistor count greater emphasis on solving specific problems new ties between ai and other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards deep blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on may in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibm s question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin faster computers algorithmic improvements and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception data hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around the kinect which provides a d body motion interface for the xbox and the xbox one uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy ai research as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones in march alphago won out of games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer go playing system to beat a professional go player without handicaps in the future of go summit alphago won a three game match with ke jie who at the time continuously held the world no ranking for two years this marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence as go is a relatively complex game more so than chess according to bloomberg s jack clark was a landmark year for artificial intelligence with the number of software projects that use ai google increased from a sporadic usage in to more than projects clark also presents factual data indicating the improvements of ai since supported by lower error rates in image processing tasks he attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets other cited examples include microsoft s development of a skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and facebook s system that can describe images to blind people in a survey one in five companies reported they had incorporated ai in some offerings or processes around china greatly accelerated its government funding given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an ai superpower however it has been acknowledged that reports regarding artificial intelligence have tended to be exaggerated computer science defines ai research as the study of intelligent agents any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals a more elaborate definition characterizes ai as a system s ability to correctly interpret external data to learn from such data and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation a typical ai analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success an ai s intended utility function or goal can be simple if the ai wins a game of go otherwise or complex perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past goals can be explicitly defined or induced if the ai is programmed for reinforcement learning goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others a alternatively an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a fitness function to mutate and preferentially replicate high scoring ai systems similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food some ai systems such as nearest neighbor instead of reason by analogy these systems are not generally given goals except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data such systems can still be benchmarked if the non goal system is framed as a system whose goal is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task ai often revolves around the use of algorithms an algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute b a complex algorithm is often built on top of other simpler algorithms a simple example of an algorithm is the following optimal for first player recipe for play at tic tac toe many ai algorithms are capable of learning from data they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics strategies or rules of thumb that have worked well in the past or can themselves write other algorithms some of the learners described below including bayesian networks decision trees and nearest neighbor could theoretically given infinite data time and memory learn to approximate any function including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world citation needed these learners could therefore derive all possible knowledge by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data in practice it is seldom possible to consider every possibility because of the phenomenon of combinatorial explosion where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially much of ai research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities unlikely to be beneficial for example when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from denver to new york in the east one can in most cases skip looking at any path through san francisco or other areas far to the west thus an ai wielding a pathfinding algorithm like a can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered the earliest and easiest to understand approach to ai was symbolism such as formal logic if an otherwise healthy adult has a fever then they may have influenza a second more general approach is bayesian inference if the current patient has a fever adjust the probability they have influenza in such and such way the third major approach extremely popular in routine business ai applications are analogizers such as svm and nearest neighbor after examining the records of known past patients whose temperature symptoms age and other factors mostly match the current patient x of those patients turned out to have influenza a fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand but is inspired by how the brain s machinery works the artificial neural network approach uses artificial neurons that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to reinforce connections that seemed to be useful these four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems for example neural nets can learn to make inferences to generalize and to make analogies some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches alongside many other ai and non ai algorithms the best approach is often different depending on the problem learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies algorithms and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future these inferences can be obvious such as since the sun rose every morning for the last days it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well they can be nuanced such as x of families have geographically separate species with color variants so there is a y chance that undiscovered black swans exist learners also work on the basis of occam s razor the simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest therefore according to occam s razor principle a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better settling on a bad overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is besides classic overfitting learners can also disappoint by learning the wrong lesson a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses a real world example is that unlike humans current image classifiers don t determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture instead they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an adversarial image that the system misclassifies c compared with humans existing ai lacks several features of human commonsense reasoning most notably humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about na ve physics such as space time and physical interactions this enables even young children to easily make inferences like if i roll this pen off a table it will fall on the floor humans also have a powerful mechanism of folk psychology that helps them to interpret natural language sentences such as the city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence a generic ai has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators this lack of common knowledge means that ai often makes different mistakes than humans make in ways that can seem incomprehensible for example existing self driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do and instead must use non human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents the cognitive capabilities of current architectures are very limited using only a simplified version of what intelligence is really capable of for instance the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life what would have been otherwise straightforward an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind this gives rise to two classes of models structuralist and functionalist the structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic the functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart the overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into sub problems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions by the late s and s ai research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a combinatorial explosion they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger even humans rarely use the step by step deduction that early ai research could model they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments knowledge representation and knowledge engineering are central to classical ai research some expert systems attempt to gather explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain in addition some projects attempt to gather the commonsense knowledge known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know and many other less well researched domains a representation of what exists is an ontology the set of objects relations concepts and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them the semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts roles and individuals and typically implemented as classes properties and individuals in the web ontology language the most general ontologies are called upper ontologies which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain field of interest or area of concern such formal knowledge representations can be used in content based indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them they need a way to visualize the future a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of available choices in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions however if the agent is not the only actor then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty this calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment multi agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence machine learning ml a fundamental concept of ai research since the field s inception is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input without requiring a human to label the inputs first supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression which requires a human to label the input data first classification is used to determine what category something belongs in and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several categories regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as function approximators trying to learn an unknown possibly implicit function for example a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories spam or not spam computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space natural language processing nlp allows machines to read and understand human language a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human written sources such as newswire texts some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval text mining question answering and machine translation many current approaches use word co occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text keyword spotting strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb a search query for dog might only match documents with the literal word dog and miss a document with the word poodle lexical affinity strategies use the occurrence of words such as accident to assess the sentiment of a document modern statistical nlp approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level beyond semantic nlp the ultimate goal of narrative nlp is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning by transformer based deep learning architectures could generate coherent text machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras visible spectrum or infrared microphones wireless signals and active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world applications include speech recognition facial recognition and object recognition computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input such input is usually ambiguous a giant fifty meter tall pedestrian far away may produce the same pixels as a nearby normal sized pedestrian requiring the ai to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations for example by using its object model to assess that fifty meter pedestrians do not exist ai is heavily used in robotics advanced robotic arms and other industrial robots widely used in modern factories can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage a modern mobile robot when given a small static and visible environment can easily determine its location and map its environment however dynamic environments such as in endoscopy the interior of a patient s breathing body pose a greater challenge motion planning is the process of breaking down a movement task into primitives such as individual joint movements such movement often involves compliant motion a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object moravec s paradox generalizes that low level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are counterintuitively difficult to program into a robot the paradox is named after hans moravec who stated in that it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one year old when it comes to perception and mobility this is attributed to the fact that unlike checkers physical dexterity has been a direct target of natural selection for millions of years moravec s paradox can be extended to many forms of social intelligence distributed multi agent coordination of autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize interpret process or simulate human affects moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal affect analysis see multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject in the long run social skills and an understanding of human emotion and game theory would be valuable to a social agent the ability to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better decisions some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate human computer interaction similarly some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously this tends to give na ve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are historically projects such as the cyc knowledge base and the massive japanese fifth generation computer systems initiative attempted to cover the breadth of human cognition these early projects failed to escape the limitations of non quantitative symbolic logic models and in retrospect greatly underestimated the difficulty of cross domain ai nowadays most current ai researchers work instead on tractable narrow ai applications such as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation many researchers predict that such narrow ai work in different individual domains will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence agi combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas many advances have general cross domain significance one high profile example is that deepmind in the s developed a generalized artificial intelligence that could learn many diverse atari games on its own and later developed a variant of the system which succeeds at sequential learning besides transfer learning hypothetical agi breakthroughs could include the development of reflective architectures that can engage in decision theoretic metareasoning and figuring out how to slurp up a comprehensive knowledge base from the entire unstructured web some argue that some kind of currently undiscovered conceptually straightforward but mathematically difficult master algorithm could lead to agi finally a few emergent approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely closely and believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain or simulated child development may someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do for example even specific straightforward tasks like machine translation require that a machine read and write in both languages nlp follow the author s argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the author s original intent social intelligence a problem like machine translation is considered ai complete because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human level machine performance no established unifying theory or paradigm guides ai research researchers disagree about many issues a few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology or is human biology as irrelevant to ai research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering can intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization or does it necessarily require solving a large number of unrelated problems in the s and s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurobiology information theory and cybernetics some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as w grey walter s turtles and the johns hopkins beast many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the teleological society at princeton university and the ratio club in england by this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the s when access to digital computers became possible in the mid s ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation the research was centered in three institutions carnegie mellon university stanford and mit and as described below each one developed its own style of research john haugeland named these symbolic approaches to ai good old fashioned ai or gofai during the s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high level thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background researchers in the s and the s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field economist herbert simon and allen newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence as well as cognitive science operations research and management science their research team used the results of psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems this tradition centered at carnegie mellon university would eventually culminate in the development of the soar architecture in the middle s unlike simon and newell john mccarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving regardless whether people used the same algorithms his laboratory at stanford sail focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems including knowledge representation planning and learning logic was also the focus of the work at the university of edinburgh and elsewhere in europe which led to the development of the programming language prolog and the science of logic programming researchers at mit such as marvin minsky and seymour papert found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad hoc solutions they argued that no simple and general principle like logic would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior roger schank described their anti logic approaches as scruffy as opposed to the neat paradigms at cmu and stanford commonsense knowledge bases such as doug lenat s cyc are an example of scruffy ai since they must be built by hand one complicated concept at a time when computers with large memories became available around researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into ai applications this knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of expert systems introduced by edward feigenbaum the first truly successful form of ai software a key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the knowledge base which stores facts and rules that illustrate ai the knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple ai applications by the s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into sub symbolic approaches to specific ai problems sub symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge this includes embodied situated behavior based and nouvelle ai researchers from the related field of robotics such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive their work revived the non symbolic point of view of the early cybernetics researchers of the s and reintroduced the use of control theory in ai this coincided with the development of the embodied mind thesis in the related field of cognitive science the idea that aspects of the body such as movement perception and visualization are required for higher intelligence within developmental robotics developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self exploration social interaction with human teachers and the use of guidance mechanisms active learning maturation motor synergies etc interest in neural networks and connectionism was revived by david rumelhart and others in the middle of the s artificial neural networks are an example of soft computing they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty and where an approximate solution is often sufficient other soft computing approaches to ai include fuzzy systems grey system theory evolutionary computation and many statistical tools the application of soft computing to ai is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of computational intelligence much of traditional gofai got bogged down on ad hoc patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real world results however around the s ai researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools such as hidden markov models hmm information theory and normative bayesian decision theory to compare or to unify competing architectures the shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or operations research d compared with gofai new statistical learning techniques such as hmm and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as data mining without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets the increased successes with real world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models ai research was becoming more scientific nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable and are sometimes with difficulty reproducible different statistical learning techniques have different limitations for example basic hmm cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language critics note that the shift from gofai to statistical learning is often also a shift away from explainable ai in agi research some scholars caution against over reliance on statistical learning and argue that continuing research into gofai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence ai has developed many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general of these methods are discussed below many problems in ai can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many possible solutions reasoning can be reduced to performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means ends analysis robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that prioritize choices in favor of those more more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps in some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal called pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size a very different kind of search came to prominence in the s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming alternatively distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic programming is a method for learning several different forms of logic are used in ai research propositional logic involves truth functions such as or and not first order logic adds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other fuzzy set theory assigns a degree of truth between and to vague statements such as alice is old or rich or tall or hungry that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false fuzzy logic is successfully used in control systems to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as if you are close to the destination station and moving fast increase the train s brake pressure these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases many ai researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy logic inferences e default logics non monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and time causal calculus belief calculus belief revision and modal logics logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi agent systems have also been designed such as paraconsistent logics many problems in ai in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for various problems reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectation maximization algorithm f planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time e g hidden markov models or kalman filters compared with symbolic logic formal bayesian inference is computationally expensive for inference to be tractable most observations must be conditionally independent of one another complicated graphs with diamonds or other loops undirected cycles can require a sophisticated method such as markov chain monte carlo which spreads an ensemble of random walkers throughout the bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities bayesian networks are used on xbox live to rate and match players wins and losses are evidence of how good a player is citation needed adsense uses a bayesian network with over million edges to learn which ads to serve a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class a class is a decision that has to be made all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches the decision tree is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm other widely used classifiers are the neural network k nearest neighbor algorithm g kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm h gaussian mixture model and the extremely popular naive bayes classifier i classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified such as the dataset size distribution of samples across classes the dimensionality and the level of noise model based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data otherwise if no matching model is available and if accuracy rather than speed or scalability is the sole concern conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers especially svm tend to be more accurate than model based classifiers such as naive bayes on most practical data sets neural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain a simple neuron n accepts input from other neurons each of which when activated or fired casts a weighted vote for or against whether neuron n should itself activate learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data one simple algorithm dubbed fire together wire together is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another the neural network forms concepts that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared j neurons that tend to fire together a concept meaning leg might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning foot that includes the sound for foot neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation in addition neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes modern neural networks can learn both continuous functions and surprisingly digital logical operations neural networks early successes included predicting the stock market and in a mostly self driving car k in the s advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust ai into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate ai spending for example ai related m a in was over times as large as in the study of non learning artificial neural networks began in the decade before the field of ai research was founded in the work of walter pitts and warren mccullouch frank rosenblatt invented the perceptron a learning network with a single layer similar to the old concept of linear regression early pioneers also include alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko teuvo kohonen stephen grossberg kunihiko fukushima christoph von der malsburg david willshaw shun ichi amari bernard widrow john hopfield eduardo r caianiello and others citation needed the main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and recurrent neural networks which allow feedback and short term memories of previous input events among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multi layer perceptrons and radial basis networks neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control for robotics or learning using such techniques as hebbian learning fire together wire together gmdh or competitive learning today neural networks are often trained by the backpropagation algorithm which has been around since as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by seppo linnainmaa and was introduced to neural networks by paul werbos hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex to summarize most neural networks use some form of gradient descent on a hand created neural topology however some research groups such as uber argue that simple neuroevolution to mutate new neural network topologies and weights may be competitive with sophisticated gradient descent approaches citation needed one advantage of neuroevolution is that it may be less prone to get caught in dead ends deep learning is the use of artificial neural networks which have several layers of neurons between the network s inputs and outputs deep learning has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence why including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing and others according to one overview the expression deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in and gained traction after igor aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to artificial neural networks in the first functional deep learning networks were published by alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko and v g lapa in page needed these networks are trained one layer at a time ivakhnenko s paper describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers already much deeper than many later networks in a publication by geoffrey hinton and ruslan salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre training many layered feedforward neural networks fnns one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then using supervised backpropagation for fine tuning similar to shallow artificial neural networks deep neural networks can model complex non linear relationships deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks cnns whose origins can be traced back to the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in in yann lecun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture in the early s in an industrial application cnns already processed an estimated to of all the checks written in the us since fast implementations of cnns on gpus have won many visual pattern recognition competitions cnns with convolutional layers were used with reinforcement learning by deepmind s alphago lee the program that beat a top go champion in early on deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks rnns which are theoretically turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs the depth of an rnn is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence thus an rnn is an example of deep learning rnns can be trained by gradient descent but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem in it was shown that unsupervised pre training of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent nn called the long short term memory lstm network published by hochreiter schmidhuber in lstm is often trained by connectionist temporal classification ctc at google microsoft and baidu this approach has revolutionized speech recognition for example in google s speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of through ctc trained lstm which is now available through google voice to billions of smartphone users google also used lstm to improve machine translation language modeling and multilingual language processing lstm combined with cnns also improved automatic image captioning and a plethora of other applications ai like electricity or the steam engine is a general purpose technology there is no consensus on how to characterize which tasks ai tends to excel at while projects such as alphazero have succeeded in generating their own knowledge from scratch many other machine learning projects require large training datasets researcher andrew ng has suggested as a highly imperfect rule of thumb that almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought we can probably now or in the near future automate using ai moravec s paradox suggests that ai lags humans at many tasks that the human brain has specifically evolved to perform well games provide a well publicized benchmark for assessing rates of progress alphago around brought the era of classical board game benchmarks to a close games of imperfect knowledge provide new challenges to ai in game theory e sports such as starcraft continue to provide additional public benchmarks many competitions and prizes such as the imagenet challenge promote research in artificial intelligence the most common areas of competition include general machine intelligence conversational behavior data mining robotic cars and robot soccer as well as conventional games the imitation game an interpretation of the turing test that assesses whether a computer can imitate a human is nowadays considered too exploitable to be a meaningful benchmark a derivative of the turing test is the completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart captcha as the name implies this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human unlike the standard turing test captcha is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine a computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test computers are unable to solve the problem so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test a common type of captcha is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer proposed universal intelligence tests aim to compare how well machines humans and even non human animals perform on problem sets that are generic as possible at an extreme the test suite can contain every possible problem weighted by kolmogorov complexity unfortunately these problem sets tend to be dominated by impoverished pattern matching exercises where a tuned ai can easily exceed human performance levels since the s advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non linear hidden units and a very large output layer by graphic processing units gpus often with ai specific enhancements had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training large scale commercial cloud ai openai estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet to alphazero and found a fold increase in the amount of compute required with a doubling time trendline of months ai is relevant to any intellectual task modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect high profile examples of ai include autonomous vehicles such as drones and self driving cars medical diagnosis creating art such as poetry proving mathematical theorems playing games such as chess or go search engines such as google search online assistants such as siri image recognition in photographs spam filtering predicting flight delays prediction of judicial decisions targeting online advertisements and energy storage with social media sites overtaking tv as a source for news for young people and news organizations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution major publishers now use artificial intelligence ai technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic ai can also produce deepfakes a content altering technology zdnet reports it presents something that did not actually occur though of americans believe deepfakes can cause more harm than good only of them believe they can be targeted the boom of election year also opens public discourse to threats of videos of falsified politician media ai in healthcare is often used for classification whether to automate initial evaluation of a ct scan or ekg or to identify high risk patients for population health the breadth of applications is rapidly increasing as an example ai is being applied to the high cost problem of dosage issues where findings suggested that ai could save billion in a groundbreaking study in california found that a mathematical formula developed with the help of ai correctly determined the accurate dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to organ patients artificial intelligence is assisting doctors according to bloomberg technology microsoft has developed ai to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer there is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer in detail there are more than medicines and vaccines to treat cancer this negatively affects the doctors because there are too many options to choose from making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called hanover citation needed its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient one project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers another study is using artificial intelligence to try to monitor multiple high risk patients and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions one study was done with transfer learning the machine performed a diagnosis similarly to a well trained ophthalmologist and could generate a decision within seconds on whether or not the patient should be referred for treatment with more than accuracy according to cnn a recent study by surgeons at the children s national medical center in washington successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot the team supervised the robot while it performed soft tissue surgery stitching together a pig s bowel during open surgery and doing so better than a human surgeon the team claimed ibm has created its own artificial intelligence computer the ibm watson which has beaten human intelligence at some levels watson has struggled to achieve success and adoption in healthcare advancements in ai have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self driving vehicles as of update there are over companies utilizing ai into the creation of self driving cars a few companies involved with ai include tesla google and apple many components contribute to the functioning of self driving cars these vehicles incorporate systems such as braking lane changing collision prevention navigation and mapping together these systems as well as high performance computers are integrated into one complex vehicle recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of self driving trucks possible though they are still in the testing phase the uk government has passed legislation to begin testing of self driving truck platoons in self driving truck platoons are a fleet of self driving trucks following the lead of one non self driving truck so the truck platoons aren t entirely autonomous yet meanwhile the daimler a german automobile corporation is testing the freightliner inspiration which is a semi autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway one main factor that influences the ability for a driverless automobile to function is mapping in general the vehicle would be pre programmed with a map of the area being driven this map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings however google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre programmed maps and instead creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings some self driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brake pedals so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions another factor that is influencing the ability of a driverless automobile is the safety of the passenger to make a driverless automobile engineers must program it to handle high risk situations these situations could include a head on collision with pedestrians the car s main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car but there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger in other words the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers the programming of the car in these situations is crucial to a successful driverless automobile financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm flagging these for human investigation the use of ai in banking can be traced back to when security pacific national bank in the us set up a fraud prevention task force to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards programs like kasisto and moneystream are using ai in financial services banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations maintain book keeping invest in stocks and manage properties ai can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place in august robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition ai has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies ai is increasingly being used by corporations jack ma has controversially predicted that ai ceo s are years away the use of ai machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories for example ai based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus individualized pricing furthermore ai machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of trades citation needed furthermore ai in the markets limits the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient citation needed other theories where ai has had impact include in rational choice rational expectations game theory lewis turning point portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking citation needed in august the aicpa introduced an ai training course for accounting professionals the cybersecurity arena faces significant challenges in the form of large scale hacking attacks of different types that harm organizations of all kinds and create billions of dollars in business damage artificial intelligence and natural language processing nlp has begun to be used by security companies for example siem security information and event management solutions the more advanced of these solutions use ai and nlp to automatically sort the data in networks into high risk and low risk information this enables security teams to focus on the attacks that have the potential to do real harm to the organization and not become victims of attacks such as denial of service dos malware and others artificial intelligence in government consists of applications and regulation artificial intelligence paired with facial recognition systems may be used for mass surveillance this is already the case in some parts of china artificial intelligence has also competed in the tama city mayoral elections in in the tech city of bengaluru in india is set to deploy ai managed traffic signal systems across the traffic signals in the city this system will involve use of cameras to ascertain traffic density and accordingly calculate the time needed to clear the traffic volume which will determine the signal duration for vehicular traffic across streets artificial intelligence ai is becoming a mainstay component of law related professions in some circumstances this analytics crunching technology is using algorithms and machine learning to do work that was previously done by entry level lawyers citation needed in electronic discovery ediscovery the industry has been focused on machine learning predictive coding technology assisted review which is a subset of ai to add to the soup of applications natural language processing nlp and automated speech recognition asr are also in vogue in the industry in video games artificial intelligence is routinely used to generate dynamic purposeful behavior in non player characters npcs in addition well understood ai techniques are routinely used for pathfinding some researchers consider npc ai in games to be a solved problem for most production tasks games with more atypical ai include the ai director of left dead and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in supreme commander the united states and other nations are developing ai applications for a range of military functions the main military applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning are to enhance c communications sensors integration and interoperability ai research is underway in the fields of intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations command and control and in a variety of semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles artificial intelligence technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed join fires between networked combat vehicles and tanks also inside manned and unmanned teams mum t ai has been incorporated into military operations in iraq and syria worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from us billion in to us billion in military drones capable of autonomous action are widely considered a useful asset many artificial intelligence researchers seek to distance themselves from military applications of ai in the hospitality industry artificial intelligence based solutions are used to reduce staff load and increase efficiency by cutting repetitive tasks frequency trends analysis guest interaction and customer needs prediction hotel services backed by artificial intelligence are represented in the form of a chatbot application virtual voice assistant and service robots for financial statements audit ai makes continuous audit possible ai tools could analyze many sets of different information immediately the potential benefit would be the overall audit risk will be reduced the level of assurance will be increased and the time duration of audit will be reduced it is possible to use ai to predict or generalize the behavior of customers from their digital footprints in order to target them with personalized promotions or build customer personas automatically a documented case reports that online gambling companies were using ai to improve customer targeting moreover the application of personality computing ai models can help reduce the cost of advertising campaigns by adding psychological targeting to more traditional sociodemographic or behavioral targeting artificial intelligence has inspired numerous creative applications including its usage to produce visual art the exhibition thinking machines art and design in the computer age at moma provides a good overview of the historical applications of ai for art architecture and design recent exhibitions showcasing the usage of ai to produce art include the google sponsored benefit and auction at the gray area foundation in san francisco where artists experimented with the deepdream algorithm and the exhibition unhuman art in the age of ai which took place in los angeles and frankfurt in the fall of in the spring of the association of computing machinery dedicated a special magazine issue to the subject of computers and art highlighting the role of machine learning in the arts the austrian ars electronica and museum of applied arts vienna opened exhibitions on ai in the ars electronica s festival out of the box extensively thematized the role of arts for a sustainable societal transformation with ai there are three philosophical questions related to ai citation needed widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable scientists from the future of life institute among others described some short term research goals to see how ai influences the economy the laws and ethics that are involved with ai and how to minimize ai security risks in the long term the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies the potential negative effects of ai and automation were a major issue for andrew yang s presidential campaign in the united states irakli beridze head of the centre for artificial intelligence and robotics at unicri united nations has expressed that i think the dangerous applications for ai from my point of view would be criminals or large terrorist organizations using it to disrupt large processes or simply do pure harm terrorists could cause harm via digital warfare or it could be a combination of robotics drones with ai and other things as well that could be really dangerous and of course other risks come from things like job losses if we have massive numbers of people losing jobs and don t find a solution it will be extremely dangerous things like lethal autonomous weapons systems should be properly governed otherwise there s massive potential of misuse physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and spacex founder elon musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that ai could evolve to the point that humans could not control it with hawking theorizing that this could spell the end of the human race the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race once humans develop artificial intelligence it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever increasing rate humans who are limited by slow biological evolution couldn t compete and would be superseded in his book superintelligence philosopher nick bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to humankind he argues that sufficiently intelligent ai if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down if this ai s goals do not fully reflect humanity s one example is an ai told to compute as many digits of pi as possible it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down ultimately to better achieve its goal bostrom also emphasizes the difficulty of fully conveying humanity s values to an advanced ai he uses the hypothetical example of giving an ai the goal to make humans smile to illustrate a misguided attempt if the ai in that scenario were to become superintelligent bostrom argues it may resort to methods that most humans would find horrifying such as inserting electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant beaming grins because that would be an efficient way to achieve its goal of making humans smile in his book human compatible ai researcher stuart j russell echoes some of bostrom s concerns while also proposing an approach to developing provably beneficial machines focused on uncertainty and deference to humans possibly involving inverse reinforcement learning concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high profile donations and investments a group of prominent tech titans including peter thiel amazon web services and musk have committed billion to openai a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible ai development the opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly capable ai other technology industry leaders believe that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans oracle ceo mark hurd has stated that ai will actually create more jobs not less jobs as humans will be needed to manage ai systems facebook ceo mark zuckerberg believes ai will unlock a huge amount of positive things such as curing disease and increasing the safety of autonomous cars in january musk donated million to the future of life institute to fund research on understanding ai decision making the goal of the institute is to grow wisdom with which we manage the growing power of technology musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as deepmind and vicarious to just keep an eye on what s going on with artificial intelligence i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there for the danger of uncontrolled advanced ai to be realized the hypothetical ai would have to overpower or out think all of humanity which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence joseph weizenbaum wrote that ai applications cannot by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of ai technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy was deeply misguided weizenbaum was also bothered that ai researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism to weizenbaum these points suggest that ai research devalues human life some are concerned that ai programs may unintentionally become biased after processing data that exhibits bias algorithms already have numerous applications in legal systems an example of this is compas a commercial program widely used by u s courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist propublica claims that the average compas assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than the average compas assigned risk level of white defendants the relationship between automation and employment is complicated while automation eliminates old jobs it also creates new jobs through micro economic and macro economic effects unlike previous waves of automation many middle class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist states that the worry that ai could do to white collar jobs what steam power did to blue collar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously subjective estimates of the risk vary widely for example michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimate of u s jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classifies only of u s jobs as high risk jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for care related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy author martin ford and others go further and argue that many jobs are routine repetitive and to an ai predictable ford warns that these jobs may be automated in the next couple of decades and that many of the new jobs may not be accessible to people with average capability even with retraining economists point out that in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but acknowledge that we re in uncharted territory with ai currently countries are researching battlefield robots including the united states china russia and the united kingdom many people concerned about risk from superintelligent ai also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers and drones machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks they may have the ability to use ethical reasoning to better choose their actions in the world as such there is a need for policy making to devise policies for and regulate artificial intelligence and robotics research in this area includes machine ethics artificial moral agents friendly ai and discussion towards building a human rights framework is also in talks wendell wallach introduced the concept of artificial moral agents ama in his book moral machines for wallach amas have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as does humanity want computers making moral decisions and can ro bots really be moral for wallach the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior unlike the constraints which society may place on the development of amas the field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making the field was delineated in the aaai fall symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about ethics machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality computational ethics or computational morality a variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition machine ethics that stems from the aaai fall symposium on machine ethics political scientist charles t rubin believes that ai can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent he argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share hyper intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop this topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization humans and planet earth one proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent ai is friendly ai and will be able to control subsequently developed ais some question whether this kind of check could actually remain in place leading ai researcher rodney brooks writes i think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent ai anytime in the next few hundred years i think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of ai and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence if an ai system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence will that system also be sentient will it have a mind which has conscious experiences this question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all human information processing is easy to explain however human subjective experience is difficult to explain for example consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it saying it s red the easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red the hard problem is that people also know something else they also know what red looks like consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like l everyone knows subjective experience exists because they do it every day e g all sighted people know what red looks like the hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it why it exists and how it is different from knowledge and other aspects of the brain computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain or both is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind body problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam the philosophical position that john searle has named strong ai states the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel if it can feel does it have the same rights as a human this issue now known as robot rights is currently being considered by for example california s institute for the future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature some critics of transhumanism argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights the subject is profoundly discussed in the documentary film plug pray and many sci fi media such as star trek next generation with the character of commander data who fought being disassembled for research and wanted to become human and the robotic holograms in voyager are there limits to how intelligent machines or human machine hybrids can be a superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent if research into strong ai produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive self improvement the new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario singularity technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control thus radically changing or even ending civilization because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable ray kurzweil has used moore s law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year and predicts that the singularity will occur in robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either this idea called transhumanism has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butler s darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in the long term economic effects of ai are uncertain a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in long term unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed a february european union white paper on artificial intelligence advocated for artificial intelligence for economic benefits including improving healthcare e g making diagnosis more precise enabling better prevention of diseases increasing the efficiency of farming contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and improving the efficiency of production systems through predictive maintenance while acknowledging potential risks the development of public sector policies for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence ai is considered necessary to both encourage ai and manage associated risks but challenging in elon musk called for regulation of ai development multiple states now have national policies under development or in place and in february the european union published its draft strategy paper for promoting and regulating ai thought capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction a common trope in these works began with mary shelley s frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters this includes such works as arthur c clarke s and stanley kubrick s a space odyssey both with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories most notably the multivac series about a super intelligent computer of the same name asimov s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimov s laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity transhumanism the merging of humans and machines is explored in the manga ghost in the shell and the science fiction series dune in the s artist hajime sorayama s sexy robots series were painted and published in japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later the gynoids book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including george lucas and other creatives sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always an unnatural product of the human mind a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer this appears in karel apek s r u r the films a i artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k dick dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence see also logic machines in fiction and list of fictional computers']"

See BrownCorpus, Text8Corpus or LineSentence in word2vec module for such examples. See also the tutorial on data streaming in Python. If you don’t supply sentences, the model is left uninitialized – use if you plan to initialize it in some other way.\n",
    "# corpus_file (str, optional) – Path to a corpus file in LineSentence format. You may use this argument instead of sentences to get performance boost. Only one of sentences or corpus_file arguments need to be passed (or none of them, in that case, the model is left uninitialized).\n",

    "# sg ({0, 1}, optional) – Training algorithm: 1 for skip-gram; otherwise CBOW.\n",
    "# hs ({0, 1}, optional) – If 1, hierarchical softmax will be used for model training. If 0, and negative is non-zero, negative sampling will be used.\n",

A value of 1.0 samples exactly in proportion to the frequencies, 0.0 samples all words equally, while a negative value samples low-frequency words more than high-frequency words. The popular default value of 0.75 was chosen by the original Word2Vec paper. More recently, in https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04212, Caselles-Dupré, Lesaint, & Royo-Letelier suggest that other values may perform better for recommendation applications.\n",

    "# min_alpha (float, optional) – Learning rate will linearly drop to min_alpha as training progresses.\n",
    "# seed (int, optional) – Seed for the random number generator. Initial vectors for each word are seeded with a hash of the concatenation of word + str(seed). Note that for a fully deterministically-reproducible run, you must also limit the model to a single worker thread (workers=1), to eliminate ordering jitter from OS thread scheduling. (In Python 3, reproducibility between interpreter launches also requires use of the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to control hash randomization).\n",
    "# max_vocab_size (int, optional) – Limits the RAM during vocabulary building; if there are more unique words than this, then prune the infrequent ones. Every 10 million word types need about 1GB of RAM. Set to None for no limit.\n",
    "# max_final_vocab (int, optional) – Limits the vocab to a target vocab size by automatically picking a matching min_count. If the specified min_count is more than the calculated min_count, the specified min_count will be used. Set to None if not required.\n",
    "# sample (float, optional) – The threshold for configuring which higher-frequency words are randomly downsampled, useful range is (0, 1e-5).\n",
    "# hashfxn (function, optional) – Hash function to use to randomly initialize weights, for increased training reproducibility.\n",
    "# iter (int, optional) – Number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus.\n",
    "# trim_rule (function, optional) –\n",
    "# Vocabulary trimming rule, specifies whether certain words should remain in the vocabulary, be trimmed away, or handled using the default (discard if word count < min_count). Can be None (min_count will be used, look to keep_vocab_item()), or a callable that accepts parameters (word, count, min_count) and returns either gensim.utils.RULE_DISCARD, gensim.utils.RULE_KEEP or gensim.utils.RULE_DEFAULT. The rule, if given, is only used to prune vocabulary during build_vocab() and is not stored as part of the model.\n",
    "# The input parameters are of the following types:\n",
    "# word (str) - the word we are examining\n",
    "# count (int) - the word’s frequency count in the corpus\n",
    "# min_count (int) - the minimum count threshold.\n",
    "# sorted_vocab ({0, 1}, optional) – If 1, sort the vocabulary by descending frequency before assigning word indexes. See sort_vocab().\n",
    "# batch_words (int, optional) – Target size (in words) for batches of examples passed to worker threads (and thus cython routines).(Larger batches will be passed if individual texts are longer than 10000 words, but the standard cython code truncates to that maximum.)\n",
    "# compute_loss (bool, optional) – If True, computes and stores loss value which can be retrieved using get_latest_training_loss().\n",
    "# callbacks (iterable of CallbackAny2Vec, optional) – Sequence of callbacks to be executed at specific stages during training."
