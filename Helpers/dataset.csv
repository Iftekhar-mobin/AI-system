This topic seeks to help you familiarize yourself with the console and its wide range of capability. The SOTI MobiControl console is divided into two sections, the main console and the legacy console. Both sections are up-to-date and fully integrated. Actions performed in the main console are reflected in the legacy console and vice versa. The main console focuses on the routine management of devices. Within the console, you can learn about the current statuses of your devices, organize your devices to accommodate your needs, and perform simple device actions such as tracking, remote controlling, or locking your devices, among others. The legacy console is devoted to less frequently performed tasks such as enrollment, software deployment, and SOTI MobiControl system operations, among others. See for a more comprehensive overview of the legacy console's capabilities. Figure 1. Switching between the consoles Use the menu button in the top left corner of the main console to switch to the legacy console and the View Devices link in the top left corner of the legacy console to switch back to the main console.

It is organized into Platform tabs, each of which governs a particular set of device types. The eight platform tabs run along the top of the legacy console interface: All Platforms, Windows Mobile/CE, Windows Desktop Classic, Windows Modern, iOS, Android Plus, Printers, and Linux. The platform tabs accommodate the deep differences between operating systems. Not all features available on one platform are available on another. It is imperative that you switch to the correct platform tab before beginning any task, as the active platform tab dictates which devices are affected. For a full list of the devices that SOTI MobiControl supports and how they sort into the different platform tabs, refer to . Along the bottom of the legacy console run sub tabs. They group related management features together. Not all sub tabs are visible from every platform tab so you should always select the platform tab first. The different functions of the sub tabs (Profiles, Rules, Packages, Reports, Servers, Security, Content Library, and Alerts) are described below. Profiles Tab Use the Profiles tab to configure and apply device settings using profiles and profile configurations. On the Profiles tab you can create, edit, and send device settings to your devices. Generally, all activity performed on the Profiles tab is covered under section of the Console Help. Rules Tab Use the Rules tab to automate certain device and system activities based on your instructions. Packages Tab Use the Package tab to upload and manage packages to SOTI MobiControl . Packages are one of SOTI MobiControl 's delivery mechanisms for deploying applications, scripts and files to your devices. Generally, all activity performed on the Packages tab is covered under the section of the Console Help. The Packages tab is not visible when the iOS tab is active. Servers Tab Use the Servers tab to perform administrative tasks for the SOTI MobiControl console. You can view information on your servers and manage the behaviour of the console and its third-party connections. The Servers tab is only visible when the All Platforms tab is active. Security Tab Use the Security tab to handle user accounts for the SOTI MobiControl console. Within it, you can create new users, user groups or pull in existing users and groups from an LDAP or IdP connection. You can also track user activity and set granular permissions for each entity. Generally, all activity performed on the Security tab is covered under the section of the Console Help. The Security tab is only visible when the All Platforms tab is active. Content Library Tab Use the Content Library tab to access a file storage and distribution system between SOTI MobiControl and your devices. Generally, all activity performed on the Content Library tab is covered under the section of the Console Help. The Content Library tab is only visible when either the Android Plus or iOS tab is active. Alerts Tab Use the Alerts tab to view information on any device or system alerts that you have set up.

45,45,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/console/start/search_bar.html,Using the Search Bar,"The device search bar is a powerful tool and a central component of device management within the SOTI MobiControl console. It allows you to quickly find or sort your devices, enabling rapid troubleshooting and reporting. The device search bar has two modes which behave very differently. The Basic search uses text entry to return any devices whose properties have matching values, whereas the Advanced search allows you to create intricate search queries that filter devices based on your criteria. The Basic search mode is geared towards finding a specific device, while the Advanced search mode is better suited for filtering devices in your deployment. See and for more comprehensive overviews of the two search modes. You can toggle between the search modes in the Search Settings menu, accessed from the magnifying glass drop-down list. Although there are other search bars present throughout SOTI MobiControl , they do not function in the same manner as the device search bar. Figure 1. Search settings menu The scope of your search is determined by the selected device group and the Include Subgroups setting. When performing a search, you can choose to run the search on all devices in your database or on a single device group. To search all devices in your database, click View All Devices before executing a search. If you choose to run it on a device group, you have the further option to run the search recursively. When Include Subgroups is enabled, devices in any child groups of the selected folder are also included in the scope of the search. Otherwise, only devices directly within the selected group are evaluated. Tip: You can save searches that you use frequently. Search Index The device search bar analyzes an index stored on the SOTI MobiControl management server for results, rather than accessing the SOTI MobiControl database directly. The index is updated in real-time as new information is obtained about a device. However, in rare circumstances, a discrepancy can occur between the index and the database. For example, if the management server was offline while devices checked in, the index would not update with their information. In this event, you can use the SOTI MobiControl Search Sync Interval setting to fix any synchronization issues. The Search Sync Interval defines how frequently SOTI MobiControl performs an integrity check and synchronizes with the database. It is a failsafe mechanism that ensures the most current information on devices is available in the console. See for instructions.

It is simple to use and most effective when using unique values such as serial number or device ID. Less precise queries may return multiple devices containing the same value but from different properties, or a partial match of the queried value.

Search terms are limited to a pre-defined set of options based on device and extended properties - auxiliary attributes such as profiles or installed applications. Each property then uses logical operators and a value to generate results. Generally, logical operators are variations on is , is not , contains , does not contain , greater than , etc. that change to suit the needs of the property. Text based properties allow the contains operator while numeric types do not. The opposite is true for the greater than operator. Some property types (generally relevant to versioning) are exceptions that are treated as both text and numeric property types. When using greater than or less than operators, the search compares values between decimal places individually and in sequence to determine which is a later version. Any value beyond the first alphabetic character is ignored. For example, “2.10” is greater than “2.9 Build 1000”. Figure 1. An advanced search query that returns all Android Plus devices in your database. The advanced search uses auto-complete to facilitate your searches. Begin typing and the search bar will suggest matching property types. To see the available device properties, activate the search bar field and scroll through the list of properties that appears. Note that not all properties are applicable to every device type. You can combine multiple properties into a single search using Boolean search operators (AND, OR, Grouped OR). AND is evaluated before OR unless it is a Grouped OR which effectively places a filter around the property types linked by OR and forces SOTI MobiControl to evaluate the two properties together. Figure 2. An advanced search query that returns Android Plus devices whose current battery status is greater than 50%. Extended Properties Extended properties are objects that are associated with a device but are not necessarily a property of the device. SOTI MobiControl supports the following extended properties: Applications Profiles LDAP groups You can group multiple properties for a single extended property object using Boolean operators. When grouped, SOTI MobiControl will execute searches against a list of records for that extended property object. For example, if you use the apps extended property, grouping allows you to search your database for devices that have applications with a matching name and version, or some other combination of criteria. Figure 3. An advanced search query using an Apps extended property object. This search returns devices with applications containing "" SOTI MobiControl "" in the name AND whose version is between 11 and 13. Any application (or other extended property object) that matches the criteria will result in the device being returned even if another application on the device does not match the criteria. When you ungroup or separate properties into their own individual extended property objects, you will receive results that match independently of one another. By default, any match of the extended property statement results in the device being included in the search results even when the desired result may be to exclude it. For example, if you try to exclude devices based on a particular application, using the NOT EQUALS operator will not achieve the desired result because the device likely has other applications that also do not match the given name. Instead, if you want to search by exclusion, you must change the extended property qualifier from Include to Exclude and then enter the search using EQUALS as the operator. Figure 4. An advanced search query using an Apps extended property object, with the option to toggle between include and Exclude . When set to Exclude , this search returns devices that DO NOT have any applications containing "" SOTI MobiControl "" in their name, whose version is between 11 and 13.

Rule filters enable you to broaden or restrict which devices get added by the rule when they connect to SOTI MobiControl . There are four types of add devices rule filter: a rule tag filter, a IP address filter, a device property filter, and a firmware version filter. Rule Tag Filters A rule tag filter restricts the rule to adding only devices with a specific device rule tag. When a SOTI MobiControl device agent is generated, a unique identifier (rule tag) is inserted into the agent. When the device agent connects to a SOTI MobiControl deployment server, it presents the server with the rule tag. When this filter is used, the deployment server will only add a device if there is a match between the rule tag presented by the agent and an add devices rule in the SOTI MobiControl database. In this way, an add devices rule will be used to add only those devices that are using an agent specifically created for that rule. This is the default filter; it is automatically added when an add devices rule is created. If this filter is deleted, then the add devices rule can be used to configure devices that are using device agents created by third parties (for example when a device agent is already installed on the device when it comes from the manufacturer) or device agents created for other add devices rules. IP Address Filters An IP address filter restricts the add devices rule to adding only those devices whose IP address falls within a specified range. This rule filter can be useful as an extra security measure to limit connections, or as a means of segregating different sets of devices. Device Property Filters A device property filter restricts the add devices rule to adding only those devices that have specified properties, such as a minimum operating system version. Firmware Version Filters A firmware version filter restricts the add devices rule to adding only those devices whose firmware version falls within a specified range.

The flexibility of Android continues with these 'work' features; whether your mobility strategy is bring your own device or purpose built device or a mix of both, Android has a solution for you. In SOTI MobiControl , Android devices with work features enabled are managed under the Android Plus banner as Android Enterprise . Enrollment, remote-control, and device configuration are all performed under Android Plus. Unless noted, Android devices with work features enabled can generally accomplish anything a regular Android device can. Work features are available on devices running Android 4.0 or later. However, in Android 4.0 to 4.4, the functionality is provided using the Android Enterprise client, which must be installed separately on the device. Beginning with Android 5.0, work features are native to the Android operating system. Device Management Type There are two types of device management for Android devices with work features enabled: work managed devices and devices with work profiles. Work managed devices are Android devices where the entire device is managed and under enterprise control. It grants administrators an extensive level of control over devices. Devices must be configured as work managed devices during the initial setup of the device. Devices with work profiles are devices where only a portion of the device is dedicated to enterprise apps and data. The rest of the device is devoted to personal apps and data and the two sections remain separated. As the device user has ultimate control, there are some limitations to device management in this scenario compared to work managed devices. Account Type When enrolling devices in SOTI MobiControl , you can choose between two types of accounts for Android devices with work features enabled: Google managed accounts and managed Google Play accounts. You can also choose to skip the Google account creation entirely. Only choose the Skip option if the devices will not require access to the managed Google Play Store. Google managed accounts are user-based and are best for situations where the device will be associated with a single user for its lifetime. See for more information. Managed Google Play accounts are device based and are best for situations where the device will be used by multiple users, such as kiosk environments. See for more information.

141,141,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/console/devices/managing/groups/groups.html,Grouping Devices,"All devices enrolled in SOTI MobiControl are organized into device groups. SOTI MobiControl has three default devices groups: Management, Sales, and Warehouse but you can create your own device groups that better suit your deployment strategy. For example, it might be useful to organize your devices based on geography or type of device rather than department. You can also nest device groups under each other to establish a hierarchy. All top-level or root device groups are listed alphabetically in left side of the console. Lower level device groups are alphabetically nested under their root groups. You can hide the device group tree by clicking the device group name in the search bar. When a device group is selected, the devices within that group appear in the Devices list. The Include Subfolders option in the Search Settings drop-down determines which devices are displayed. When enabled, Include Subfolders shows all devices under the device group, including devices in device groups nested under the selected group. When disabled, only devices directly within the selected group appear. You can also choose to see all of your devices, irrespective of device grouping by clicking View All Devices . You can assign device configuration settings and perform some device actions on whole device groups at once. Note: It is important to take your console security into consideration when organizing your device groups. SOTI MobiControl allows you to tailor which users have access to which device groups, which can have important ramifications on the structure of your device group tree. If you plan to assign different permissions based on device group, you should organize your device group structure based on security then considering your deployment's other needs. Some user permissions relevant to device group management include: The View Groups permission which restricts who can view a group. The Manage Groups permission which restricts who can edit filter criteria The Manage Root Groups permission which restricts who can create groups at the root level. The View Absolute Devices Path permission which allows users to see the names and structures of the device tree but not the devices within the device groups they do not have permission for. All users, regardless of permissions, will be able to see full path of a device group in a device's Device Information panel, even if the path includes device groups they do not have permission to view. Virtual and Filter Device Groups In addition to regular device groups, you can create virtual and filter device groups. Virtual groups let you group devices from different device groups together without moving them from their 'real' device groups, essentially creating a reference for each device in the virtual group. In the device group tree, virtual groups are marked by a curved arrow icon. Filter groups are virtual groups whose membership is established according to user-defined criteria. Any device that matches the criteria is automatically placed within the filter group, while remaining in its 'real' device group. Where you create a filter group affects its membership: Filter groups created at the root level draw their membership from all of the devices in your database. Filter groups created under another group are only populated by the devices within that branch of the device group tree. In the device group tree, filter groups are marked by a filter icon. You cannot move a device into or out of a filter group without editing the filter criteria. Devices that were in the virtual group before it was transformed into a filter group are removed from the group unless they meet the criteria. If you remove all filter criteria, all devices will be removed and the filter device group will become an empty virtual group. Note: Placing filter and virtual groups at the root level can expose devices to SOTI MobiControl users who would otherwise be unable to see them. Consider restricting who can view and create device groups at the root level and review your permissions model for the virtual or filter groups that you do create at the root level.

Devices report their status details and any other data requested by the administrator to the deployment server, while the deployment server verifies that the current settings and configurations of the device match those listed in the database. The deployment server fixes any inconsistencies between the two by adding, removing, or altering the device's settings, configurations or applications as necessary. The schedule for device check-ins are initially set by the add devices rule associated with a device, but you can change the schedule at any time after enrollment. You can also initiate a device check-in to immediately synchronize your devices to SOTI MobiControl . Certain device configuration changes are pushed down to devices immediately, rather than waiting for the scheduled check-in.

As you cannot enroll iOS devices without a valid APNS certificate, you are unlikely to encounter a situation where enrolled iOS devices cannot check in. In Windows Modern devices, you can choose to either enable or opt out of the (WNS). If you choose to opt-out of the WNS, device configuration changes will only be pushed to your devices according to the scheduled device check-in.

Kiosk Mode replaces the standard device home screen with a customizable interface that provides the device user access to authorized applications and websites only. When you create a Kiosk Mode profile configuration, you must also create an profile configuration with a Device Administrator Password configured. This allows you to dismiss the Kiosk Mode menu directly on the device. You can also choose to configure a User Password Policy . If a user password policy is not defined, device users can access the Kiosk Mode menu immediately after turning on the device. If a user password policy is defined, device users must enter the password to access the Kiosk Mode menu. Once activated, Kiosk Mode mode can be disabled in two different ways: you can revoke the Kiosk Mode profile configuration or you can disable it directly from the device.

Advanced Lockdown Settings Package Blocking SOTI MobiControl also offers an alternative to the default Lockdown method. Package blocking prevents applications from launching or running in the background unless explicitly allowed by the active Lockdown policy. Package blocking can be overly restrictive and cause issues by inadvertently blocking system applications. Only enable package blocking after careful testing of the Lockdown configuration on all models and configurations of the devices in your deployment, and only where over-the-air updates are prevented. Samsung Package Disabling On some Samsung devices, you can disable undesired activities at the package level. This option is only available on Samsung devices running Android 5.0 or later with MDM 5 or later and that have a SOTI MobiControl agent 13.3.1 installed. Speed Control You can configure lockdown to activate when the device is going over a certain speed. The speed of the device is determined by the device's GPS unit.

200,200,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/console/configurations/profiles/configurations/categories/restrictions/lockdown_templates.html,Customizing Lockdown Menu Templates,"SOTI MobiControl allows you to modify preconfigured lockdown menu templates or to build your own lockdown menu templates. A lockdown menu template is an HTML file with special menu tags that get replaced by SOTI MobiControl when it generates the menu. Essentially, the menu tags get replaced by the menu item links that you configure for your lockdown menu. The easiest way to create a custom lockdown menu template is to make a copy of one of the default templates, customize it, and then add it to the list of available templates. The following table describes the special menu tags that get replaced in the HTML file. Tag Name Description <MCMenuFull> This tag gets replaced with the full menu list that the user has configured. The menu items are separated by carriage returns.

SOTI MobiControl will deliver the image to the device. Alternatively, if you do not want to use SOTI MobiControl to deliver the image, you can simply specify in the HTML template the full path to the graphic for where it will be found on the mobile device (e.g. <img src=""file:///SDCard/images/CompanyLogo.jpg""> ). URIs Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name or a resource on the Android Device. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The SOTI MobiControl Lockdown on Android devices allows you to use custom URIs. Such URIs include Launch://, Http://, Https://, File:// and Browser://. Linking to the SOTI MobiControl Device Configuration Applet The SOTI MobiControl device applet that is normally accessed by tapping on the SOTI MobiControl icon on the Today screen or system tray of the device contains a bounty of useful status information. This information can be very useful when trying to troubleshoot a problem in the field, for example resolving connectivity issues between the device and the SOTI MobiControl deployment server. To create a link to the applet from the lockdown program menu add a program entry to the following path: net.soti.mobicontrol Edit Menu Template List In the Edit Template Menu List dialog box, click Add and navigate to the location of your customized lockdown page and select it. You will see the customized menu template in this list now. You can chose to edit this template further by clicking on Edit and launching the lockdown menu template editor, or click on Close and then select the template from the Lockdown Menu. You can edit the lockdown menu templates using the built-in HTML editor. After saving a modified template, be sure to select the template file in the combo selection box on the main Lockdown Configuration page. Basic HTML, Java, and Flash are supported in the lockdown. Tip: You can easily include a graphic in your HTML template by selecting the Insert Image menu option in the HTML Editor.

When setting up the file sync rule, the deployment server must have permission to read and write to the specified server location. SOTI recommends that you use a UNC path and that the deployment server is run under its own Active Directory user profile. You can use a local path if only one deployment server is being used and the local path points to a location on the computer running the deployment server. File sync rules are available on the Android Plus, iOS, Linux, Windows Desktop Classic, Windows Mobile/CE, and Windows Modern platforms. Note: On the iOS platform, files synced to devices are also placed in the . However, content library policies will not apply to these files. File Sync Scripts You can use scripts to add automatic processes to the file sync.

SOTI MobiControl provides several utilities for managing devices on the deployment server, including one for moving devices. If you run a device move utility prior to file synchronization, you can ensure that all devices are in the proper location before any files are exchanged. Contact for help using this utility.

Once you install the SOTI Hub app on your devices, your device users can access content from a content repository (a WebDAV or SharePoint 2013 (On-Premises) server) whose connection was enabled in SOTI MobiControl . SOTI Hub is compatible with devices running Android 4.1 or later and Apple devices running iOS 8 or later. Features SOTI Hub has the following capabilities: LDAP Authentication You can employ the LDAP credentials already on your content repository as your authentication method for the SOTI Hub app. You must have enrolled your devices using LDAP. Mandatory Folders and Files You can mark certain folders or files in your content repository as ""mandatory"". These folders and files are downloaded to the SOTI Hub app on your devices. Device users cannot remove these files or folders from the app and changes to the content repository are automatically reflected when the SOTI Hub app next connects to the content repository. See for more information. Download Resumption The download resumption feature continues interrupted downloads from the point of disconnect when the network comes back online. The device user has three opportunities to complete the download before the download must be completely restarted. Download resumption is triggered only when the download was interrupted by a network connectivity problem. If the SOTI Hub app closes or the device user logs out of the app, all in-progress downloads are cancelled. Note: This features is only compatible with WebDAV content repositories because it requires the SOTI apps Server extension. Search on Server Search on server allows device users to search all the content available on the repository from their device. Intermittent search expedites the process by returning search results as they are found rather than when the full search is complete. Note: The SOTI apps Server extension is required for intermittent search. Offline Functionality The SOTI Hub app retains some limited functionality when a device has no network connection or the content repository is offline. Disconnected device users are still able to view any downloaded or cached files and folders. Depending on your SOTI app configuration settings, device users can log into the app if their password matches the cached value of the field.

When it is enabled, device users must enter the correct Apple ID and password to wipe or reactivate a device. Activation lock is part of the Find My iPhone feature set and is automatically enabled with Find My iPhone. It is only disabled again once Find My iPhone is turned off completely. SOTI MobiControl automatically enables activation lock on enrolled supervised iOS devices but you can disable it as needed. SOTI MobiControl cannot manage the feature on unsupervised devices. Activation lock is available on devices running iOS 7 or later. See on the feature for more information. Activation Lock Bypass While activation lock is useful in many situations, it can cause issues when transferring iOS devices between device users. To facilitate simpler device re-assignment, Apple provides a method to bypass activation lock through the SOTI MobiControl console, avoiding the tedium of deactivating the feature on each device individually. Each iOS device with activation lock enabled generates an activation lock bypass code that it sends to SOTI MobiControl when it first checks in. The code is thereafter stored in the Device Information panel. Before wiping an iOS device with activation lock enabled, you should initiate a bypass activation lock device action which sends the code to the iOS device and allows the device to automatically bypass the activation lock step of the reactivation process. If you forget to initiate the bypass before wiping the device, you can still reactivate the device manually, using the code. There are some limitations to activation lock bypass. iOS devices only generate the code once per 'lifetime'. Devices must be factory reset to re-generate the code. If you are transferring a device from another MDM or even from another SOTI MobiControl instance, and the phone has not been factory reset, SOTI MobiControl cannot retrieve the activation lock bypass code from the device.

380,380,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/console/devices/monitoring/temrules/using.html,Using Telecom Expense Management Rules,"A telecom expense management (TEM) rule monitors the usage of cellular data and voice minutes for a device or group of devices, allowing you track costs throughout your organization. In addition to passive monitoring, you can set alerts to notify you when devices exceed their allotted limits, set thresholds to block further usage, and even set follow-up actions when a threshold is hit such as sending messages to devices or moving devices to other device groups. You can use TEM rules on the Android Plus, iOS, and Windows Mobile/CE platforms for devices with device agents installed. On iOS devices however, TEM tracking faces some restrictions. SOTI MobiControl can only track cellular data usage on iOS devices, not voice minutes. Furthermore, SOTI MobiControl can only collect statistics when the iOS device agent is in the foreground; unless Location Services are enabled on the device and the device is using a SOTI MobiControl SDK-enabled application. Telecom Plans When setting up your TEM rule, you must create a telecom plan that sets the data and voice limits. SOTI MobiControl compares the plan to the device(s)' usage to see if it exceeds the plan. You can create multiple telecom plans to match any plans present within your organization. There are two types of telecom plans: Corporate Group and Individual . Generally, you should use the corporate group plan when the TEM rule targets a device group rather than a single device. Usage Tracking Considerations Usage information collected by SOTI MobiControl may not match data usage reports from your telecommunications provider. TEM rules are intended only as a supplementary tool to help you track your devices' data usage. In addition to general variances, the following situations may cause discrepancies between data usage statistics collected from SOTI MobiControl and those from your telecommunications provider: If a SIM card is switched If the SOTI MobiControl device agent is uninstalled (and then reinstalled) on the device If the Network Statistics setting on the device is reset Parent topic: Related reference © 2019 Email: © 2019 Email:",console devices monitoring temrules using,Using Telecom Expense Management Rules console devices monitoring temrules using

Using our location services, you can analyze the movements of your devices, enabling you to find lost devices, develop more efficient routes, or control which services your devices can access depending on location. Location services are available for the following device families: Android Plus, iOS, Windows Desktop Classic, and Windows Mobile / CE. SOTI MobiControl uses a combination of a device's GPS signal, WiFi and cellular connections to determine location and requires that devices have a device agent installed and online. On iOS devices, location tracking can also be facilitated with the installation of a SOTI MobiControl SDK-enabled app. Location tracking is powered by Bing Maps and offers basic mapping and navigation services. Tracking Devices SOTI MobiControl provides two options for tracking your devices to accommodate different circumstances. For short-term scrutiny, you can enable tracking in the Device Information dialog window. Once enabled, SOTI MobiControl will continue to track the movements of the device until the set end time or you manually stop the tracking. Location data is reported according to the frequency you set and each data point is reflected on the map by a point. For long-term tracking, you can leverage a data collection rule to regularly request a device's location. You must set up and activate a data collection rule for location before you can use it for long term tracking. Once enabled, the device's movements will be visible on the Location map for the period covered by the data collection rule. Geofences Geofences are virtual, geographic boundaries that you can apply to your devices. When a device enters or exits an area covered by a geofence, SOTI MobiControl will notify you and, if configured, perform a predefined action such as sending messages to devices, relocating the device to another device group or blocking access to certain services. Geofences allow you to track and regulate device movements easily and automatically. Geofences can be as large or small as is necessary and can be easily manipulated to cover any space.

The device agent must have been launched at least once and have its location services set to Always in iOS Location Services settings. The SOTI MobiControl agent uses a low power detection method and collects the approximate location of a device when it makes significant changes in physical location. The iOS device must have an active cellular connection to report its location. Important: When actively locating the device, the device agent must be in the foreground of the device. However, location tracking data can be collected while the agent is in the background. SOTI MobiControl SDK for iOS The SOTI MobiControl SDK for iOS allows you to incorporate features of the SOTI MobiControl iOS device agent into your own enterprise or App Store applications. If you install an SDK-enabled app on your devices, SOTI MobiControl uses both the device agent and the SDK-enabled app to track location. Both applications have the same dependencies but can operate independently of each other. See for more information.

This is achieved by capturing a number of security measurements during boot time and protecting the reported data in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) of the device. The boot measurements are then forwarded to the Health Attestation Service (HAS), hosted by Microsoft, to attest to the authenticity and integrity of the reported measurements. If a device report fails to meet the enterprise security compliance criteria, administrators can then take preventative actions, such as un-enrolling the device or removing VPN configurations. A health status report is requested each time a Windows Modern device checks in to SOTI MobiControl . Every report prepared by a device is sent to the HAS and SOTI MobiControl pulls each report down from HAS and checks to make sure all devices are compliant according to the report. Health attestation is supported on Windows Modern devices running Windows 10 or later. You can view the details of a device's compliance in its Device Information panel. Health Attestation compliance information resides in the Health Attestation Details section of the Device Details tab. Historical data on compliance is also stored in the database for future reporting. The Device Health Attestation report requires that devices have internet access to the HAS hosted by Microsoft. Devices must also support Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 or higher. Incompatible devices are reported and because support for TPM on the device can potentially be upgraded in the future, the incompatibility warnings are not suppressed. You can create a specialized that you customize to prioritize parameters based on their importance for your organization. For example, if it is not relevant to your organization's security that the Test Signing parameter is non-compliant, you can disable it in your Health Policy, so that your devices report compliance based only on relevant parameters.

483,483,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/console/devices/managing/actions/update_os.html,Updating the Operating System of iOS Devices,"Note: You can only update an iOS device to the latest available version of its operating system, and the upgrade is not reversible. To update the operating system of an iOS device: In the console, select the iOS device or devices whose operating system you want to update. Note: SOTI MobiControl automatically prompts all compatible iOS devices to scan for OS updates every 24 hours. However, you can use the Scan for OS Updates device action to force your devices to initiate a scan immediately. For security and stability reasons, OEMs often stagger the roll out of updates to devices. Therefore, if an update has only recently been released, different devices may receive different results, even if they are currently running the same OS version. In either the Device Information panel (if you selected one device) or the Device Actions menu bar (if you selected multiple devices), click the More menu button and select Scan for OS Updates in the Device Actions menu. The Scan for OS Updates dialog box opens. If a warning message appears at the bottom of the dialog box, click on the message to get more information about the warning. In the Scan for OS Updates dialog box, click the Scan for OS Updates button. Note: If the device is currently offline, it will scan for OS updates the next time it checks in. To see whether an OS update is available for an iOS device, open the Device Information panel for the device and check the Software Updates section of the panel. This step must be performed on each device individually. In the console, select all devices with available updates, click the More menu button, then select Update OS in the Device Actions menu. The Update OS dialog box opens. In the Update OS dialog box, select one of the following options from the OS Update Method list: Download and Install The Software Update Download The Software Update But Do Not Install It Install An Already Downloaded Software Update If a warning message appears at the bottom of the dialog box, click on the message to get more information about the warning. In the Update OS dialog box, click the Update OS button to start the update. Once the update begins, you can monitor its progress in the Device Information panel. Status information is updated whenever the device checks in, but you can also use a Refresh OS Update Status device action to immediately update the information.

You either create a blacklist (or whitelist) or block websites based on content type. When a blacklist is applied, any sites on the blacklist will redirect the device user to the default URL for blocked websites or a blank page, depending on your settings. A whitelist is more restrictive than a blacklist. The device user can only access the sites specified on the whitelist. Any attempt by the device user to access non-whitelisted sites will redirect the device user to the default URL or a blank page, depending on your settings. Redirect URLs are automatically whitelisted. You cannot apply both a blacklist and a whitelist within the same profile configuration. If a device receives a blacklist and a whitelist from two different profiles, the whitelist will apply, overriding the blacklist. If a device receives multiple blacklists or multiple whitelists from different profiles, then the websites (and exceptions) from all profiles are unioned.

If there is a conflict between the settings of different configurations, the most restrictive settings apply. For example, if an Inactivity Timeout is set on one configuration but not the other, the inactivity timeout applies for the device. Every time a SOTI Hub configuration is reassigned to devices, device users are logged out while the SOTI Hub app applies the changes. General Description Enter the name of the SOTI Hub configuration. This name will be used as the description for the configuration. Note: This field cannot contain any of the following characters: ' , "" , ` Application Settings Allow user to save password Allow the device user to save a password for the login screen. If you have set a Prefill Username (but not the Prefill Password - see below), the application will also remember the username. Content Refresh Interval Specify how frequently (in minutes) the SOTI Hub app contacts the content repository server and synchronizes any changes to the content on the SOTI Hub app. Inactivity Timeout Specify how long (in minutes) the app can be inactive (i.e. the screen is off, or the user has not interacted with the app etc.) before the device user is logged out of the SOTI Hub app. Enter 0 to disable the inactivity timeout. Cancel Downloads on Inactivity Timeout Cancel any downloads that are in progress when the Inactivity Timeout period expires. This option is selected by default. If it is not set, the Inactivity Timeout period begins only after all downloads are completed. This option is not available when the >Inactivity Timeout is set to 0 . Content Repository Settings The content repository stores any files that you want your device users to access through the SOTI Hub app. The content repository must be hosted on an NTFS file server that is accessible via an IIS WebDAV server or a SharePoint 2013 (On-Premises) server. See for more information. Repository URL Enter the URL of the site for your repository. The SOTI Hub app uses this URL to access the content repository server. The port may be specified as part of the URL. If you plan to route traffic through the Enterprise Resource Gateway, specify the internal URL used to access the content repository server. Repository Type Choose the type of server that your content repository is hosted on. Choose either WebDAV or SharePoint 2013 (On Premises) . Path Enter a path to a subfolder of the content repository if you do not want your device users to have access to the entire repository. Only one folder path can be specified. If the field is left blank, all folders under the Repository URL are selected. Filter Restrict which file types your device users can access based on file extension. Device users will only see those files types specified by the filter. All other files are invisible to the device user. Enter file filters with the following format: *. extension You can separate different extension types with commas. For example: *.doc , *.pdf , *.txt Alias Specify a root folder for the content repository within the SOTI Hub app to separate (or merge) content from multiple content repositories. Content from the repository appears under a named Alias folder, within the ""My Library"" section of the SOTI Hub app. If you do not specify an Alias folder, enterprise content appears directly under the ""My Library"" section of the SOTI Hub app. You may only use one Alias per repository. If you use the same Alias on different repositories, content from both those repositories appears under one root folder on the device user's SOTI Hub app. Domain Specify the domain that is prefixed to the username when exchanging login credentials with the content repository server. The following macro is supported: %ENROLLEDUSER_DOMAIN% Note: To use macros, your devices must have been enrolled using this domain. Prefill Username Specify the username that is used to authenticate the SOTI Hub user to the content repository server. This value appears in the username field of the SOTI Hub application's login page and will be uneditable. If a username is not specified, the user will be prompted for login credentials.

Label Type Select the type of label that your printer is using: Continuous: Prints labels based on configured label length Gap/Notch: Prints labels based on detecting gaps/notches between labels Mark: Prints labels based on black mark at the back of the label which printers recognize as end point and start point of labels Label Removal Method Determines how the label is removed while printing is occurring. Methods include: Tear Off : Printer prints as fast as it is set to with no pause Peel Off : label backing is peeled off by the printer hardware Rewind : Printer hardware component peels the back off of the label. A mechanical arm rolls up peeled backing. Applicator : For printers equipped with an applicator board to synchronize printing with control device signaling Cutter : Mechanical cutter is triggered to cut from the rest. The printer waits until the cut is completed before printing the next label. Delayed Cut : Printer only cuts when it receives a command from the printing software. RFID : Printer detects the RFID element of the label and prints accordingly Linerless Peel : Printer waits until the previous label is torn off before printing the next label. Linerless Rewind : Linerless paper is wound onto the option rewind bar. Kiosk : Printer follows behavior determined by kiosk use. Linerless Tear : Prints linerless labels for the user to tear off. Printer does not wait between labels if more than one is printed. Stream : Prints second label before first label's printing is completed but does not complete second label's print until the next Start Print signal is received. Distance between label gap and mark Set the distance between the label gap and black mark. Label Position (left edge) Set the position of the left starting edge of the label. Length of Printer Label Set the length of the printer label. Width of Printer Label Set the width of the printer label.

Users have access only to authorized applications, and are prevented from accessing all other applications and device controls. By locking down devices, organizations can minimize the risk of unauthorized persons accessing information on their mobile devices. Administrators can control exactly which programs users are allowed to run. This decreases the amount of down-time caused by users changing settings that may adversely affect the operation of the device or application software, and also decreases support costs. SOTI MobiControl allows running the mobile devices in a kiosk mode with a read-only access to provide critical information to the end users, without giving them the ability to change the settings. Note: Assigned Access is available only on devices running Windows 8.1. Once the Assigned Access configuration has been applied, you must factory reset the device if you want to remove the configuration.

Notify User : Notify the user before downloading the update. This policy is used by enterprises that want to enable end-users to manage data usage. With this option users are notified when there are updates that apply to the device and are ready for download. Users can download and install the updates from the Windows Update control panel. Install and Notify : Auto install the update and then notify the user to schedule a restart. Updates are downloaded automatically on non-metered networks and installed during ""Automatic Maintenance"" when the computer is not in use and is not running on battery power. If automatic maintenance is unable to install updates for two days, Windows Update will install updates right away. If the installation requires a restart, the end-user is prompted to schedule the restart time. The end-user has up to seven days to schedule the restart and after that, a restart is forced. Enabling the end-user to control the restart time reduces the risk of accidental app data loss caused by apps that do not shutdown properly on restart. Install and Restart : Auto install and restart. Updates are downloaded automatically on non-metered networks and installed during ""Automatic Maintenance"" when the computer is not in use and is not running on battery power. If automatic maintenance is unable to install updates for two days, Windows Update will install updates right away. If a restart is required, then the device is automatically restarted when the device is not actively being used. This is the default behavior for unmanaged devices. Devices are updated quickly, but it increases the risk of accidental app data loss caused by apps that do not shutdown properly on restart. Install and Restart at Specific Time : Auto install and restart at a specified time. The IT administrator specifies the installation day and time. If no day and time are specified, the default is 3 AM daily. Automatic installation happens at this time and restart happens after a 15-minute countdown. If the user is logged in when Windows is ready to restart, the user can interrupt the 15-minute countdown to delay the restart. Install and Restart Without User Control : Auto install and restart without end-user control. Updates are downloaded automatically on non-metered networks and installed during ""Automatic Maintenance"" when the computer is not in use and is not running on battery power. If automatic maintenance is unable to install updates for two days, Windows Update will install updates right away. If a restart is required, then the device is automatically restarted when the device is not actively being used. It sets the end-user control panel to read-only. No Auto Updates : Turn off automatic updates. WP10 Disable Non-Microsoft Signed Update Disallow the IT administrator to manage whether Automatic Updates accepts updates signed by entities other than Microsoft when the update is found at the UpdateServiceUrl location.

Data Recovery Certificate (Important in Case of Data Loss) Allows you to recover encrypted data that might be lost if an account is locked or becomes inaccessible, by verifying your right to access that information. Note: It is recommended that you use a Data Recovery Agent (DRA) template from ADCS. Applications Use the Applications tab to specify which applications have access to enterprise data on your devices. Use the list of Available Applications to configure which applications can open your enterprise data. Available applications are divided into two sections: Predefined Legacy Applications ( *.msi ) or Predefined Modern Applications ( *.appx ). Applications with a lightbulb icon are Enlightened Applications . Enlightened applications can differentiate between corporate and personal data and only encrypt corporate data. Unenlightened applications consider all data corporate and encrypt everything. Exempt applications are allowed to access enterprise data without encrypting it. Use the arrows to add applications to the Enforced Applications list. While an application is selected in the Available Application list, click the single right-pointing arrow to move it into the Enforced Applications list. Once an application is in the Enforced Applications list you can chose its behaviour. Double-click on Allow to open a drop-down with the following options: Allow : Applies your WIP policy to this application Block : Blocks the application from accessing your enterprise data Exempt : Exempts the applications from your WIP policy, allowing it to access enterprise data without encryption. This option is primarily for applications that may have compatibility issues with WIP but are necessary for your company's productivity. Use this option carefully as exemption from WIP increases the chances of a data leak from your applications. Networks Use this tab to set boundaries for the Windows Information Protection profile configuration.

User Directory Options Use this tab to specify options for Windows Active Directory-based authentication. When you choose Windows Active Directory-based authentication, the SOTI MobiControl agent will directly authenticate the user's credentials with the Active Directory server associated with the configured domain. The Active Directory server requires SSL security to be enabled, and ports 636 and 443 to be open between the SOTI MobiControl deployment server and the Active Directory server. If your organization is using a non-standard port to communicate over SSL with your Active Directory server, then a colon "":"" must be used to indicate the port being used (for example, mydomain.com:1234 ). If no other connections are available, the agent will attempt to initiate a data connection if one has already been configured. For information about how to configure an Active Directory connection, see . Select a Windows Active Directory connection from the list. If you need to modify a connection, or create a new one, click the Manage button next to the list to open the LDAP Connections Manager . Restrict users to this domain Select this option to force the user to be authenticated against a particular domain controller.

This option is suitable only for environments where devices are shared among a group of people and there are no personal settings stored on the device.

This option must be selected if you are using Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, since a Windows Mobile device is only capable of synchronizing with the account of a single user. If you wish to reset which device user is bound to a given device: While the device is online, right-click on it in the device tree, and click Configure Devices , then click Security , click Authentication Policy and click Configure to open a dialog box in which you can click the Reset User Binding button. Note: When you click the Reset User Binding button it will reset the binding instantly, so there is no need to click the OK button. Allow all domain users to log on the device Select this option to allow all domain users to log in and use the device. This option is suitable only for environments where devices are shared among a group of people and there are no personal settings stored on the device. Allow users to create a simple authentication password This option will allow the user to create a simplified password and use this password when trying to log into the device instead of using their Active Directory password. This option is handy when the Active Directory password for the user is very complex and it is too tedious to enter on the device. To set password length and complexity requirements, click the Policies button. Login Screen This is the image that appears on the device login screen. Select an image file from the list or click Browse to select an image on your file system. Device Lock Screen This is the image that appears on the device lock screen. Select an image file from the list or click Browse to select an image on your file system. Display notification screen when device is locked Configures the device to present a clear indication of the device's locked status to users. Integrate with Windows Mobile device authentication subsystem When this option is selected, the agent is registered with the operating system authentication subsystem and replaces the standard password prompt with its custom password prompt. This provides maximum security for the device because the password prompt engages immediately on device startup, ensuring the device cannot be accessed without the user first providing the user or administrator password. With this option, the password prompt is automatically re-engaged when the operating system determines that the idle timeout has expired. Note: This option is applicable only when both an administrator password and a user password have been configured and the device is running the Windows Mobile 5 or later operating system. For devices running other operating systems, the password prompt is handled at the application layer and is not driven directly by the operating system. In some cases you may wish to disable this option to avoid the authentication plug-in from conflicting with other third-party security solutions that may be running on the device. © 2019 Email:",console reference dialogs profiles windowsmobile profile authentication userpolicyad windowsmobile,Authentication Policy console reference dialogs profiles windowsmobile profile authentication userpolicyad windowsmobile

1173,1173,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/console/reference/dialogs/agents/devicenamingmacros.html,Device Naming Macros,"The following macros can be used for naming devices. %AUTONUM% Allows you to automatically use a numbered sequence as part of the device name. For example, if the value of this field is set to WH%AUTONUM% , then the first device configured will be assigned a name of WH00001 , the second device will have a name of WH00002 , and so on. %MAC% Expands to the MAC address of the device. This macro is suitable for use with devices that have a wireless or wired networking capability. The MAC address is a unique number that is built into the network hardware used on the device. In most cases SOTI MobiControl can retrieve the MAC address from the hardware. For example, if the value of this field is set to DEV%MAC% , then the device names configured would look similar to DEV00A0F85324D4 and DEV00A0F8533422 . When the %MAC% macro is used as the device ID, the wifi radio must be enabled when the agent is installed in order for the macro to work. %HOSTNAME% Expands to the local hostname of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where unique hostnames have previously been assigned to devices before the device agent is installed. %IP% Expands to the IP address of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the devices have wireless or wired networking capabilities and are using fixed IP addresses. The use of this macro is not suitable for situations in which the devices are using dynamic IP addresses (i.e. DHCP) since when the IP address changes the device name will be incorrect. %PHONENUMBER% Expands to the phone number of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices, the phone number may not be available. %IMEI% Expands to the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices the IMEI number may not available. %ESN% Expands to the ESN (Electronic Serial Number) of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices the ESN number may not available. %IMSI% Expands to the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) number of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices the IMSI number may not available. %REG://% Expands to the registry in the device. This will allow custom names like serial number (read from registry key) to be used out of the box for device naming. For example, %REG://HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Apps\SOTI\MobiControl?VN=ESN% %TXT://% Gets the content of a specified line of the text file. (If LN is not specified, it assumes the first line.) For example, %TXT://\Device.log?LN=1% %INI://% Pulls a value from a section in a .ini file and makes it the device name. For example, %INI://\pdb.ini?SC=Device&NM=DeviceName% %EXE://% Gets the exit code of the executable and makes it the device name. For example, %EXE://\windows\system32\calc.exe% %STDOUT% Pulls the first line of STDOUT output of the executable and makes it the device name.

We recommend using this macro only in cases where unique hostnames have previously been assigned to devices before the device agent is installed. %IP% Expands to the IP address of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the devices have wireless or wired networking capabilities and are using fixed IP addresses. The use of this macro is not suitable for situations in which the devices are using dynamic IP addresses (i.e. DHCP) since when the IP address changes the device name will be incorrect. %PHONENUMBER% Expands to the phone number of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices, the phone number may not be available. %IMEI% Expands to the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices the IMEI number may not available. %ESN% Expands to the ESN (Electronic Serial Number) of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices the ESN number may not available. %IMSI% Expands to the IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) number of the device. We recommend using this macro only in cases where the device is a Smartphone or Pocket PC Phone Edition. For some devices the IMSI number may not available. %REG://% Expands to the registry in the device. This will allow custom names like serial number (read from registry key) to be used out of the box for device naming. For example, %REG://HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Apps\SOTI\MobiControl?VN=ESN% %TXT://% Gets the content of a specified line of the text file. (If LN is not specified, it assumes the first line.) For example, %TXT://\Device.log?LN=1% %INI://% Pulls a value from a section in a .ini file and makes it the device name. For example, %INI://\pdb.ini?SC=Device&NM=DeviceName% %EXE://% Gets the exit code of the executable and makes it the device name. For example, %EXE://\windows\system32\calc.exe% %STDOUT% Pulls the first line of STDOUT output of the executable and makes it the device name. For example, %STDOUT://cmd.exe /c dir% © 2019 Email:",console reference dialogs agents devicenamingmacros,Device Naming Macros console reference dialogs agents devicenamingmacros
1174,1174,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/console/reference/dialogs/agents/agentbuilder_parameters.html,Agent Builder: Parameters,"Configure the parameters you want built into the device agent. Automatic Deployment Server Discovery Sets whether the device agent will attempt to discover deployment servers using UDP broadcasts when it cannot connect to the configured servers. If you have multiple SOTI MobiControl installations on the same network, you must set a unique site name for each installation so that the discovery process will not detect servers in a different installation. Accept Direct Remote Control Connections Sets whether the device agent will accept direct remote control connections (TCP/IP remote control connection profile). A direct connection improves performance by reducing latency, but it requires the device to accept the connection without authentication unless SSL security is enabled. Remote control is permitted via the TCP/IP (Server) remote control connection profile regardless of this setting. Device Stable Storage Folder Sets the stable storage folder. The stable storage folder is a special folder on the device that is not erased when the device is hard reset. The device agent stores its installer, settings and packages in this folder so that the device agent can be automatically reinstalled after a hard reset. Note: Stable storage folders do not exist on all devices. For devices that do not feature a stable storage folder, SOTI MobiControl will default to a standard folder on the file system. Optionally, you may use an external SD card as the stable storage folder. This option is not recommended in most scenarios, as removal of the SD card will severely impact the operation of the device agent. Device Identifier Sets the method used to create the unique identifier for each device. List Agent in Remove Programs Sets whether the device agent is listed in the Remove Programs settings applet on the device. When this parameter is set to Off , the agent is not listed, preventing it from being uninstalled by the device user. Deployment Server(s) Sets the deployment server that the device agent connect to. The device agent connects to the deployment server to receive configuration information, software, and data. It is critical that the device be able to reach the IP address of the deployment server via the IP network to which the device is connected. If the device will be on a public network such as the Internet, you will need to set up an externally routable address for your deployment server in the SOTI MobiControl Administration Utility . See for information on setting up an external IP address for the deployment server. Note: Configuration of the deployment server address should be performed before agents are created, as the address information will be embedded into the agent installer. Set Windows Device Name Sets the Windows device name to be the same as the system assigned name.

With time, event logs and the database in which they are stored grow in size. If the size of the logs is not limited, they can cause the database to grow substantially and eventually run out of space. To avoid such situations, log maintenance is highly recommended. Note: Truncation occurs at midnight (local time of the management service); however the management service truncates records according to the UTC time stamp. Data Truncation The Data Truncation tab enables you to configure truncation of the historical data stored in the database based on log entry age. For example, if you wish to truncate device-generated logs older than 6 months, you would select Device generated and set the time to 6 months. Selecting the Archive option will save the truncated logs to a file. To specify the folder in which you want the truncated log file to be saved, select the Archive folder option and enter the local or UNC path to the folder in the corresponding text field. Note: When using a UNC path, make sure that the SOTI MobiControl server has read and write access to the specified path. Data Deletion Select the Delete archives older than option to delete archives that are older than the specified time. Once these files are deleted, there is no way to restore these files. Make sure they are backed up first if you need them at a later date. Select the Delete devices which are offline more than option to automatically delete devices that have not connected during the specified time.

For example, use filter=BatteryStatus%3E38%20AND%20CellularCarrier%3D%27Communications%20Network%27 to find devices with battery statuses greater than 35% AND whose cellular carrier has a name containing the terms ""Communications Network"". Use name value pairs for GET /devices . For example, use {Family}:{Linux}, {IsAgentOnline}:{TRUE} to find Linux devices whose agents are online.

1333,1333,https://www.soti.net/mc/help/v14.0/en/scriptcmds/start/environmentvariables.html,Using Environment Variables,"You can use environment variables with SOTI MobiControl script commands. In general, an environment variable's name and value can be any ASCII character string. However, certain strings are reserved or have special meanings. You can combine an environment variable with any command in place of a literal value. Simply enclose the environment variable in %. For example, %environmentvariable% . The script ""showmessagebox %environmentvariable% would show a message box containing the value of variable %environmentvariable% . Setting Environment Variable Values You add values to the environment variables using the set command. set var1=Hello gives var1 the value of Hello . You can nest variables. For example, the two commands set var1=Hello and set var2=%var1% world! would grant var2 the value of Hello World! You can also pull information from a string and use it in a variable. For example, set var1=Substring ""Hi Hello World Goodbye"" 4 11 showmessagebox %var1% would display Hello World on the device screen. Reserved Variables The system reserved variable errorlevel always has an integral value. You can assign integer values to this variable, but you cannot delete it.

Note: Only applications that are included in the device's firmware can be used in this command. enable_system_app appBundleID Example To add Google Chrome to the Android Enterprise container : enable_system_app com.android.chrome finishpkg Finishes the current script without processing the rest of the package and reports package installation as successful to the deployment server. This is useful particularly in packages that involve wiping a device. This script command can be used to skip reinstalling the package but still report back as successfully installed to the deployment server. If a hard reset is initiated from a package's post-install script, the entire package will reinstall after the reset. A check can be included in the pre-install script that determines whether the package's files have already been installed. Note: This command is not useful as a script command in and of itself but in the event of a package that involves a cold boot. finishpkg Example If a package's post-install script contains : md ""1:\PersistantStorage\subfolder""reset /w then the pre-install script could contain a check to prevent the package from being reinstalled endlessly: if exist ""1:\PersistantStorage\subfolder"" finishpkg foregroundmode Switches the SOTI MobiControl service between foreground and background modes. While running in foreground mode the SOTI MobiControl process receives high priority and is not killed by the system. While the service is running in foreground mode, a SOTI MobiControl icon is displayed in the notification area of the device. foregroundmode enable|disable Example To enable foregroundmode foreground enable ftp Copies a file or directory from an ftp server ftp [get|mget|wget] [-r,-o] source destination Where get copies a file on the ftp server to the local computer wget copies a file on the local computer to the ftp server -r specifies recursive -o specifies to override existing files Example To copy a file from ftp to local SD card on the device : ftp get -o To copy a folder from the device to ftp server : ftp wget -o -r ftp:://user:password@server/folder %sdcard%www identify_activity Identifies the current top activity on the device identify_activity identify_package_certificate Identifies the signature of a package and displays it in the device ADB logs identify_package_certificate packageName Example identify_package_certificate com.my.helloworld ifconfig Displays the configuration of the network interfaces on the SOTI MobiControl console ifconfig interfaceName Where if no interfaceName is provided, then all is used as the default and lists all interfaces. Use -i with all to display the interface names only. Example To list all interface names : ifconfig all -i To show the configuration of eth0 interface ifconfig eth0 install Installs an application on the device install appInstallerPath Where appInstallerPath is the full path to the application installer file on the device Example To install the Gmail app located on an sd card : install /mnt/sdcard/Gmail.apk install_system_update Installs a system update from the specified file This device cannot be used on encrypted devices. Use the sendintent command instead. install_system_update filename Example To install a system update from a file on an SD card : install_system_update /sdcard/et1.zip Note: If /sdcard does not work, use /storage/sdcard0 instead, as in: install_system_update /storage/sdcard0/et1.zip installpackage Installs a SOTI MobiControl package built using Package Studio Note: This command is not recursive and can only be used through the console or an API call to install a previously sideloaded package. It is not intended for use within one package to install another package. installpackage pathToPackage Example To install a package from the %tmp% folder : installpackage %tmp%package1.pcg now ipaddr Lists the IP addresses of the device ipaddr kill_application Terminates a process that is currently running on the device kill_application packageName Example To terminate the Angry Birds game process on the device kill_application com.rovio.angrybirds list_volumes Lists storage volume information of remote managed device.

Example To set the orientation of the lockdown screen to landscape : lockdownorientation landscape To set the orientation of the lockdown screen to portrait : lockdownorientation portrait log Sends a customs message to the SOTI MobiControl deployment server from the device. This message appears in the Logs tab of the Device Information panel in the SOTI MobiControl console. log type message Where type is the type of the associated message and the options are: -e for Error -w for Warning -i for Information Example To send a notification to the SOTI MobiControl console at certain intervals during a software push : Note: Put the command in the pre-install script log -i ""Starting Software Push"" malwarescan Initiates a Webroot scan for malware on the device malwarescan mkdir or md Creates a new directory mkdir [drive:] path Example To create a directory named ""test"" from the current directory : mkdir test To create test\test1\test2\test3 recursively : mkdir test \test1 \test2 \test3 mxconfig Submits XML configuration instructions to the MX layer of the device. Note: This script command is only applicable on Zebra Android devices. mxconfig uses the StageNow XML format (MXMS) mxconfig xmlFilepath Example mxconfig /sdcard/test.xml mxxmlconfig Executes an xml command from the inputPath and puts the result into the outputPath . Note: This command is only supported on devices that support the older XML format (MX Legacy). mxxmlconfig inputPath outputPath Where inputPath is the path to an xml file containing configuration settings for MX XML API. outputPath is the path to a folder for the script execution result notify Sends a script that notifies other SOTI applications about data sync. You can use it to notify lockdown applications that lockdown view synchronized. Added in v9 to support re-enrolling a device on another SOTI MobiControl system notify alias or notify package receiver Where alias is a friendly name for the kiosk app. Example To notify kiosk about data sync : notify kiosk or notify net.soti.mobicontrol.lockdown net.soti.mobicontrol.lockdown.LockDownUpdateReceiver promptpasswordchange Prompts user to change or set a password on their device by displaying a ""Password Policy Pending"" notification in the device agent. promptpasswordchange rem Inserts a comment line in a script/batch file. rem [ comment ] Example To add a comment about pumpkins : rem The pumpkins are looking great this harvest removemanagedinfo Removes Samsung managed info for specified applications Note: This command is only available on Samsung devices. removemanagedinfo packageName reset Performs a soft or hard reset of the device reset [/S | /H | /W | /E] [/delay sec ] Where /S is the default option and soft resets the device. Any desktop remote control sessions will also be terminated. /H is used to hard reset a device running on the Windows Pocket PC or Windows CE platforms. It clears any data stored in the volatile memory. On Windows Mobile 5.0 and later devices this is equivalent to a soft reset. The real-time clock may also reset depending on the device make and model. /W is used to wipe data stored on the device and reset the device to factory default settings. Note: The wipe command is only supported on the Windows Mobile 5 operating system with AKU2 or later and newer versions of Windows Mobile. /E is used to wipe data stored on the device and its external storage as well as reset the device to factory default settings. On Android Plus devices it is possible to specify a /delay parameter (in seconds): reset /S /delay 10 If /delay parameter is not defined, the default value is 5 seconds Example To soft reset a device : reset /S To reset an Android Plus device to its factory settings in 30 seconds : reset /E /delay 30 resetpassword Resets device password to new password resetpassword newPassword Example To reset current password to password12345 resetpassword password12345 resetwifiproxy Clears proxy configuration settings for the specified SSID (which should exist on the device before sending the command).

Example To remove an empty directory named ""test"" from the current directory : rmdir test To remove a directory named ""test"" and all of its contents from the current directory : rmdir /S test To provide location : rmdir /mnt/sdcard/test sendintent Sends intent to devices See for more information sendreport Sends a debug report from the device agent to the SOTI ftp server sendreport set_system_update_policy Configures the system update policy for Android devices with work feature enabled. Note: Only supported on Android devices running Android 6.0 or later and with Android work features enabled. set_system_update_policy policy type [startTime] [endTime] Where policy type specifies the behaviour of the update policy with the following options: 0 is the default option and represents the platform's default behaviour 1 is Automatic . The system update installs automatically as soon as an update is available 2 is Windowed . The system update is only installed automatically when the system clock is inside a daily maintenance window. The maintenance window lasts for 30 days after which the system reverts to the default policy. 3 is Postpone . The system update can be postponed a specified length for a maximum of 30 days. After expiration, the system reverts back to default policy. startTime is the start of the maintenance window. Only applicable on the Windowed policy type. Time endTime is the end of the maintenance window. Only applicable on the Windowed policy type. Note: Regarding the time parameters for Windowed policy: Time parameters are measured as the number of minutes from midnight in the device's local time. They must be in the range of 0-1440. If the start and end times are the same, the window is considered to include the WHOLE 24 hours, that is, updates can install at any time. If start time is later than end time, the window is considered to span midnight. Example To set the system update policy as default : set_system_update_policy 0 To set the system update policy as windowed with the maintenance window set to occur from 11 pm to 3 am : set_system_update_policy 2 1380 180 setfirewallproxy Sets proxy configuration on device level (iptables based). Note: Supported on devices with Samsung MDM v2 and later only. setfirewallproxy host port containerID Example setfirewallproxy 192.168.2.127 8080 setlocale Sets the device's default locale Note: Supported on Motorola Android Plus devices with a signed agent only. setlocale locale setmobiledata Enables or disables mobile data on a device Note: These settings may conflict with device feature control, and settings are non-restrictive and non-persistent. setmobiledata 0|1 Where 0 disables mobile data and 1 enables mobile data. Example To disable mobile data : setmobiledata 0 To enable mobile data setmobiledata 1 setradioenable Enables or disables WiFi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks for the device. If the phone radio is disabled, no telephony functionalities in terms of both audio and data can occur. A phone reboot will typically re-enable the radio again. Note: These settings may conflict with device feature control, and settings are non-restrictive and non-persistent. setradioenable wifi|bt|phone 0|1 Where wifi is WiFi bt is Bluetooth phone is Cellular 0 disables the radio 1 enables the radio Example To disable Bluetooth radio setradioenable bt 0 To enable WiFi setradioenable wifi 1 setwifiproxy Sets WiFi proxy settings using a provided host and port for the specified SSID. The access point ID should exist on the device before sending this command. Note: Supported on devices running Android 4.0. setwifiproxy ssid host port Example To set up a WiFi proxy : setwifiproxy 105 192.168.2.127 8080 showmessagebox Displays a message box on the device screen Note: The Android Plus agent has the following limitations: It does not support a complex showmessagebox that contains more than one command It cannot return the user response It does not support ""if"" and related keywords showmessagebox message [ timer ] [ type ] [ default button ] Where message is the message displayed in the message box. Use quotation marks ("" "") if there are spaces in the message. [ timer ] is the number of seconds until the message box disappears automatically. If you omit a timer value or add the keyword NO_TIMER , the message box will persist until the device user dismisses it. [ type ] is type of of message box. Options are: 1 displays an information window with an OK button 2 displays a question window with Yes and No buttons 3 displays a warning window with an OK button 4 displays a question window with OK and Cancel buttons 5 displays an error window with an OK button [ default button ] sets the default buttons for message box types 2 ( YES | NO ) or 4 ( OK | CANCEL ) The return values for the showmessagebox are stored in a global variable, ShowMessageBoxReturn This variable can be used in scripts as %ShowMessageBoxReturn% to execute actions based on user response. Possible return values are IDYES , IDNO , IDOK , IDCANCEL . The value for this global variable does not change if the type is not 2 or 4. Example To show a simple message : showmessagebox "" This is a test message "" To provide device information using a macro : showmessagebox ""Your device's IP address is %IP%"" To set a 3 second timer to your message : showmessagebox ""This is a test message with a 3 second timer"" 3 To add YES and NO buttons to your message box with no timer showmessagebox ""This is a test message with Yes/No button and no timer"" NO_TIMER 2 To provide followup actions to a user response to message box : showmessagebox ""Abort the operation?"" NO_TIMER 4 YES if %ShowMessageBoxReturn% == IDYES goto Exit shutdown Turns off the device shutdown [delay] Where delay is a time period in seconds. Example To turn off the device : shutdown To turn off the device in 25 seconds : shutdown 25 sleep Initiates sleep mode on the device for a set period. Only use this command in scripts. sleep [ length ] Where length is in seconds Example To set the device to sleep for 5 seconds : sleep 5 sleepex Initiates sleep mode on the device for a set period.

Note: Only supported on Android devices running Android 6.0 or later and with Android work features enabled. set_system_update_policy policy type [startTime] [endTime] Where policy type specifies the behaviour of the update policy with the following options: 0 is the default option and represents the platform's default behaviour 1 is Automatic . The system update installs automatically as soon as an update is available 2 is Windowed . The system update is only installed automatically when the system clock is inside a daily maintenance window. The maintenance window lasts for 30 days after which the system reverts to the default policy. 3 is Postpone . The system update can be postponed a specified length for a maximum of 30 days. After expiration, the system reverts back to default policy. startTime is the start of the maintenance window. Only applicable on the Windowed policy type. Time endTime is the end of the maintenance window. Only applicable on the Windowed policy type. Note: Regarding the time parameters for Windowed policy: Time parameters are measured as the number of minutes from midnight in the device's local time. They must be in the range of 0-1440. If the start and end times are the same, the window is considered to include the WHOLE 24 hours, that is, updates can install at any time. If start time is later than end time, the window is considered to span midnight. Example To set the system update policy as default : set_system_update_policy 0 To set the system update policy as windowed with the maintenance window set to occur from 11 pm to 3 am : set_system_update_policy 2 1380 180 setfirewallproxy Sets proxy configuration on device level (iptables based).

This is useful particularly in packages that involve wiping a device. This script command can be used to skip reinstalling the package but still report back as successfully installed to the deployment server. If a hard reset is initiated from a package's post-install script, the entire package will reinstall after the reset. A check can be included in the pre-install script that determines whether the package's files have already been installed. Note: This command is not useful as a script command in and of itself but in the event of a package that involves a cold boot. finishpkg Example If a package's post-install script contains : md ""1:\PersistantStorage\subfolder""reset /w then the pre-install script could contain a check to prevent the package from being reinstalled endlessly: if exist ""1:\PersistantStorage\subfolder"" finishpkg goto Directs script execution to a labelled line in a script.

On Windows Mobile/CE and Desktop Classic devices, files can be copied between desktop computers and mobile devices. On Android devices, files can only be copied locally. copy source destination Example To copy all files with the extension .txt from the C:\ to the temp directory on the device : C:\tempt\*.txt 1:\temp del Deletes one or more files del filename Example To delete example.txt in the current directory : del example.txt To delete all files with the extension .tmp in the current directory and its subfolders : del *.tmp dir Displays a list of files and subdirectories in a directory dir [ drive :][ path ][ directoryName ] Example To list the files in the Temp directory of the device : dir 1:\Temp\ echo Displays messages or switches command echoing on or off echo [on | off] or echo message Example To turn command echoing off : echo off To turn command echoing on : echo on To display the message ""Copying Files ..."" : echo Copying Files ... exit Closes the remote help desk application window exit find Finds a file on the device find [/S] [ filename ] Where /S applies the search to any subfolders Example To search for all files with a .txt file extension including subfolders : find /S *.txt finishpkg Finishes the current script without processing the rest of the package and reports package installation as successful to the deployment server. This is useful particularly in packages that involve wiping a device. This script command can be used to skip reinstalling the package but still report back as successfully installed to the deployment server. If a hard reset is initiated from a package's post-install script, the entire package will reinstall after the reset. A check can be included in the pre-install script that determines whether the package's files have already been installed. Note: This command is not useful as a script command in and of itself but in the event of a package that involves a cold boot. finishpkg Example If a package's post-install script contains : md ""1:\PersistantStorage\subfolder""reset /w then the pre-install script could contain a check to prevent the package from being reinstalled endlessly: if exist ""1:\PersistantStorage\subfolder"" finishpkg goto Directs script execution to a labelled line in a script. Only use this command in scripts. goto label Example To go to label "":end"" copy *.* 1:\tmp goto end ... :end help or ?

Administrators create a custom barcode that contains provisioning instructions. Once the device users scan the barcode with their devices, the device will automatically perform any provisioning tasks assigned by the administrator. Using the barcodes, you can set basic device configuration settings such as an enrollment ID, WiFi connection details, or other device settings. You can point devices to FTP or HTTP servers for file download. You can even direct the device to connect to the SOTI MobiControl deployment server where it can download and install the SOTI MobiControl device agent. Request the SOTI MobiControl Stage app for your devices from SOTI sales. If your devices already have the SOTI MobiControl device agent installed, they can also use the agent to scan the barcode.

This Software as a Service (SaaS) provides the same feature set available in an on-premises deployment of SOTI MobiControl , which often leverages other on-premises enterprise services such as directory services, and certificate authorities. In most environments, enterprise services are sequestered behind a corporate firewall and are not exposed to the internet where SOTI MobiControl Cloud connections originate. Without the ability to communicate with these services SOTI MobiControl Cloud cannot provide features such as directory-authenticated device enrollment and automated certificate distribution. To overcome these limitations, SOTI MobiControl offers Cloud Link Agent, a light, on-premises component which securely extends enterprise services to SOTI MobiControl Cloud . Cloud Link Agent accepts SOTI MobiControl Cloud requests and forwards them to the respective enterprise service, and then relays the response back to SOTI MobiControl Cloud in real-time. This SOTI MobiControl Cloud Link document is a technology overview and configuration guide. It also provides insight on several advanced deployment options including communication through a reverse proxy such as a Microsoft Threat Management Gateway (TMG) and load balancing SOTI MobiControl Cloud Link communication. Note: This document does not cover the initial setup of SOTI MobiControl and assumes that you have basic knowledge and administrative access to all involved systems and firewalls.

SOTI MobiControl provides a Client Certificate for authenticating to the Cloud Link agent, which can be validated by the Cloud Link agent or a reverse proxy. Given the flexible deployment options for Cloud Link , a Server Certificate for the Cloud Link agent is not provided and must be purchased or issued by your corporate infrastructure. Purchase or issue a Server Certificate for the Cloud Link agent with a Common Name matching the FQDN with which SOTI MobiControl Cloud will communicate. Decide whether to issue your own Client Certificate or use the one provided by SOTI MobiControl Cloud . Ensure you have the Root Certificate on hand for any Certificate Authority you use to issue certificates. Request an Intermediate Certificate from SOTI MobiControl technical support to complete the certificate trust chain between the Cloud Link Agent and the SOTI MobiControl Cloud server.

In this topology, SOTI MobiControl Cloud is configured to communicate with the reverse proxy as if it was the Cloud Link Agent. The reverse proxy provides validation of the Client Certificate presented by SOTI MobiControl Cloud in the request and then publishes the request along with an authentication token to the Cloud Link Agent. The Cloud Link Agent verifies the authentication token and then returns the requested information to SOTI MobiControl Cloud . Note: The reverse proxy must support passing a Windows Identity to the Cloud Link Agent. Generally, this is achieved through the Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD), which requires that the reverse proxy and the Cloud Link Agent host be bound to the same Active Directory domain with the appropriate Service Principal Name (SPN) present. The following diagram illustrates Cloud Link communication through a Reverse Proxy and outlines the authentication flow of this topology.

In this topology, SOTI MobiControl Cloud makes requests to the load balancer, which balances the requests across multiple Cloud Link Agents. The load balancer is transparent to the SOTI MobiControl Cloud , therefore mutual authentication is formed between SOTI MobiControl Cloud and the Cloud Link Agent directly. Note: Cloud Link communication is stateless, so the use of sticky sessions can be avoided. It is therefore important that each Cloud Link Agent have the Server Certificate that matches the load balancer's fully qualified domain name. The following diagram illustrates the Load Balanced Cloud Link Communication deployment option. Network Requirements The ""Load Balanced Cloud Link Communication Matrix"" table represents the communication requirements for load balanced SOTI MobiControl Cloud to Cloud Link Agent communication.

This is achieved by capturing a number of security measurements during boot time and protecting the reported data in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) of the device. The boot measurements are then forwarded to the Health Attestation Service (HAS), hosted by Microsoft, to attest to the authenticity and integrity of the reported measurements. If a device report fails to meet the enterprise security compliance criteria, administrators can then take preventative actions, such as un-enrolling the device or removing VPN configurations. A health status report is requested each time a Windows Modern device checks in to SOTI MobiControl . Every report prepared by a device is sent to the HAS and SOTI MobiControl pulls each report down from HAS and checks to make sure all devices are compliant according to the report. Health attestation is supported on Windows Modern devices running Windows 10 or later. You can view the details of a device's compliance in its Device Information panel. Health Attestation compliance information resides in the Health Attestation Details section of the Device Details tab. Historical data on compliance is also stored in the database for future reporting. The Device Health Attestation report requires that devices have internet access to the HAS hosted by Microsoft. Devices must also support Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 or higher. Incompatible devices are reported and because support for TPM on the device can potentially be upgraded in the future, the incompatibility warnings are not suppressed.
